Abstract
Over  the  past  few  decades,  credit  scoring  has  become  an  important  tool  in  the  financial 
sector.  It  enables  banks  and  financial  institutions  to  assess  the  creditworthiness  of  indi-
viduals and reduce the risk of default. As a result of significant advances in artificial intel-
ligence techniques. Machine learning (ML) has made it possible to improve credit scoring 
by distinguishing between people with good creditworthiness and those with poorer credit-
worthiness. In this article, we propose a systematic literature review of ML-based financial 
credit scoring methods published between 2018 and 2024. A total of 330 research papers 
were  extracted  from  four  different  online  databases  and  digital  libraries. After  the  study 
selection  procedure,  63  research  papers  were  selected  for  this  systematic  review.  This 
paper aims to identify the major ML methods used in credit scoring, assess their strengths 
and  limitations,  and  highlight  notable  trends  and  advancements.  In  addition,  the  review 
addresses  the  critical  challenges  faced  in  the  adoption  of  ML  models  for  credit  scoring. 
This study not only contributes to the understanding of effective ML techniques used for 
credit  scoring  but  also  guides  future  research  by  highlighting  the  promising  avenues  in 
ML-based credit scoring efforts.

1  Introduction

In the contemporary highly dynamic and fast-paced financial landscape, banks and financial 
institutions face the challenge of processing a large volume of loan applications quickly and 
efficiently. Before the adoption of credit scoring, lending decisions were often influenced 
by  subjective  judgments,  personal  biases,  and  intuitive  assessments.  In  addition,  manual 
assessment of each borrower would be time-consuming and error-prone, leading to delays 
and inconsistent decision-making (Kumar et al. 2021).

Credit scoring has since emerged as a cornerstone of modern lending practices. By offer-
ing a systematic, data-driven approach to evaluating borrower creditworthiness, it has trans-
formed the lending industry. At its core, credit scoring quantifies credit risk using applicants’ 
financial behavior and repayment history. It ensures objectivity, minimizes human bias, and 
allows financial institutions to tailor loan terms based on risk profiles, thereby optimizing 
risk-adjusted returns (Atiya 2001). The automation of credit risk evaluation not only accel-
erates loan approval processes enhancing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction, 
but also strengthens financial stability for both lenders and borrowers.

Historically,  standardized  credit  scoring  models  have  been  dominated  by  major  credit 
bureaus such as Equifax (Kenny 2018), Experian (Bradford 2007), and TransUnion (Macey 
and Miller 1988). In the U.S., these agencies typically rely on the FICO score (Smith 2011), 
which assesses five key factors: payment history, amounts owed, length of credit history, 
new credit, and credit mix. These components are weighted to predict the borrower’s likeli-
hood of default.

Traditional models most commonly based on logistic regression or scorecards, are val-
ued for their interpretability, transparency, and regulatory acceptance (Malmi 2001). How-
ever,  their  limitations  are  significant:  they  depend  on  narrow  feature  sets,  assume  linear 
relationships, and struggle to model complex behavioral patterns (Dastile et al. 2020). As a 
result, they often underperform with non-traditional or heterogeneous credit profiles.

Complementing  these  scoring  frameworks  are  regulatory  standards  such  as  the  Inter-
national  Financial  Reporting  Standard  9  (IFRS  9)  (ElKelish  2021),  which  mandates  the 
estimation of Expected Credit Loss (ECL) through three parameters: Probability of Default 
(PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and Loss Given Default (LGD). PD, derived from histori-
cal repayment data, is the most influential factor (Bhatore et al. 2020), while LGD reflects 
the proportion of unrecovered assets and is calculated as one minus the recovery rate (Bhan-
dary and Ghosh 2025). EAD denotes the loan exposure subject to credit risk. IFRS 9 pro-
motes proactive credit risk recognition, enabling more accurate provisioning by integrating 
historical data, present conditions, and reasonable forecasts.

Recent  advances  in  ML  have  unlocked  new  capabilities  for  credit  risk  modeling.  ML 
models can capture nonlinearities, handle high-dimensional data, and adapt to evolving bor-
rower behavior (Lenka et al. 2022). They also allow the incorporation of alternative data 
sources such as social media or mobile usage, enhancing prediction accuracy and enabling 
more  personalized  assessments  (Markov  et  al.  2022).  Consequently,  ML  has  garnered 
increasing  attention  for  its  potential  to  improve  the  accuracy,  fairness,  and  efficiency  of 
credit scoring systems (Hayashi 2022).

Nevertheless, several research challenges persist. Many studies lack standardized data-
sets,  preprocessing  methods,  or  evaluation  metrics,  hindering  cross-study  comparisons. 
Complex models, such as Deep Learning (DL) and hybrid systems, often lack interpretabil-

ity, and although tools like LIME (Ribeiro et al. 2019) and SHAP (Lundberg and Lee 2017) 
are  emerging,  their  reliability  and  adoption  remain  limited.  Integrating  alternative  data 
sources into scalable systems raises ethical and privacy concerns. Issues of algorithmic bias 
remain insufficiently addressed, posing serious risks of discriminatory lending. Moreover, 
high-dimensional inputs can lead to overfitting or computational inefficiency, and feature 
selection is frequently overlooked. The deployment of advanced models is also hampered 
by their computational complexity, which may be prohibitive for smaller institutions.

This systematic literature review (SLR) presents a comprehensive synthesis of existing 
research on ML applications in credit scoring. It evaluates how ML methods address the 
limitations of traditional approaches and explores their capacity to deliver scalable, reliable, 
and ethically sound credit decisions. We identify key ML techniques, assess their strengths 
and weaknesses, and analyze emerging trends and innovations. This review also addresses 
critical challenges in implementation, including interpretability, bias, and dimensionality, 
and highlights areas for future research.

By  consolidating  findings  from  a  broad  range  of  studies,  this  SLR  aims  to  inform 
researchers, practitioners, and financial institutions alike. It clarifies gaps in the current lit-
erature, summarizes major opportunities and risks, and offers actionable recommendations. 
Ultimately, this work contributes to the development of more transparent, fair, and robust 
ML-based  credit  scoring  systems,  advancing  financial  inclusion  and  reinforcing  trust  in 
automated financial decisions.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 lists some related works that over-
lap with the problem of credit scoring. Sect. 3 describes the methodology of the literature 
review. Section 4 presents the ML methods used for credit scoring. Section 5 presents the 
performance evaluation criteria. Section 6 presents the results. Section 7 presents the discus-
sion of this review. Section 8 addresses the limitations of this review, and Sect. 9 concludes 
the paper with ideas for further work.

2  Related work

Several literature reviews have examined the use of ML techniques for borrower classifica-
tion in credit scoring. This section summarizes the most important reviews in this area.

Dastile  et  al.  (2020)  examined  74  studies  (2010–2018)  on  statistical  and  ML  models 
for credit scoring. They found that ensemble methods such as Random Forests (RF) and 
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) outperformed single classifiers and reaching 79% 
accuracy. Among DL models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieved the high-
est AUC of 90% on the German dataset and 99% on the Australian dataset. Key limitations 
identified included the lack of macroeconomic variables and insufficient exploratory data 
analysis, both critical for robust model development. The authors proposed a framework 
addressing data preparation, feature extraction, and baseline models like Logistic Regres-
sion (LR) and Decision Trees (DT). They recommended future work on class imbalance 
(like SMOTE Chawla et al. 2002), feature selection, and alternative classification thresholds.
In Kumar et al. (2021), the authors focused on credit scoring in rural finance, emphasizing 
the role of Financial Technology (fintech) and ML/AI in improving access to underserved 
populations.  They  highlighted  ML  models  such  as  Artificial  Neural  Networks  (ANN), 
SVMs, RF, LR, and hybrid models as effective tools for credit assessment. The study found

that hybrid and AI-ML-based models yielded higher accuracy and efficiency by integrating 
multiple techniques. Additionally, it stressed the importance of regulatory frameworks and 
algorithmic transparency to ensure ethical implementation. These models were especially 
impactful in rural contexts, enabling more inclusive credit access through the processing of 
diverse data sources.

Hayashi  (2022)  conducted  a  systematic  review  (2019–2022)  on  DL  in  credit  scoring, 
highlighting the superior performance of Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) over models like 
SVMs (Noble 2006), Gradient Boosting Trees (Ke et al. 2017), RFs (Breiman 2001), and LR 
(Wright 1995). DBNs, using unsupervised learning, effectively extract deep features. The 
study compared DL with ensemble and hybrid models on standard datasets and explored 
novel approaches, such as converting tabular data into images for CNNs (Gu et al. 2018). 
It addressed the interpretability challenge through rule extraction and stressed compliance 
with GDPR (Tokarski 2020). The highest accuracy (98.66%) was achieved by Acharya et al. 
(2022), with another model scoring 93.16% on the Japanese dataset (Zhang et al. 2021). The 
review concluded that DL holds strong potential for integrating structured and unstructured 
data with improved accuracy and explainability.

Lenka  et  al.  (2022)  presented  an  analysis  of  Ensemble  Learning  (EL)  for  imbalanced 
credit  scoring  dataset.  The  research  explored  the  impact  of  resampling  techniques  like 
SMOTE and different feature selection methods such as information gain, principal com-
ponent  analysis,  and  Genetic Algorithms  (GAs)  on  improving  the  performance  of  credit 
scoring models. The study conducted an extensive comparative analysis of 5 bases and 14 
ensemble models using german, australian, and japanese datasets. The results highlighted 
the effectiveness of the GA based feature selection technique and the CatBoost algorithm, 
achieving  the  best  accuracy  with  86.70%,  88.40%,  and  86.20%,  respectively.  The  study 
concluded by recommending the combination of CatBoost with GA-based feature selection 
for building accurate and reliable credit scoring models.

In Markov et al. (2022), a review of credit scoring methodologies from 2016 to 2021 was 
conducted, highlighting the evolution of credit risk assessment and its influence on lend-
ing, investment, and risk management decisions. Using a systematic approach, the authors 
compared recent trends with those from 1991 to 2015, examining the shift from traditional 
models  such  as  LR  and  DTs  to  more  advanced  techniques  like  SVMs,  ensemble  meth-
ods, and neural networks. A key finding was the growing prominence of ensemble models, 
recognized for their superior predictive performance. The review also noted the diversity 
of complex models grouped under the "Other" category, which, despite performance vari-
ability, often produced strong results when appropriately applied. Furthermore, the study 
highlighted the frequent use of public datasets such as the Australian and German credit 
datasets, which enhance model development, address class imbalance issues, and support 
reproducibility and generalization. This reflects a broader trend in credit scoring research.

Kamimura et al. (2023) conducted a review of 46 studies on optimization methods for 
Credit Scoring Models (CSMs) published between 2008 and 2022. The review identified a 
wide use of techniques including financial analysis, ML, and data mining. Logistic Regres-
sion (13%), Naive Bayes (10%), and Neural Networks (7%) were the most commonly used 
methods, with a growing trend toward hybrid models (72%). The study emphasized the need 
to integrate big data and DL for future CSM development and highlighted the importance 
of addressing legal, ethical, and practical issues. It also called for more research focused on 
small businesses and the use of diverse data sources.

4  Machine learning methods for the credit scoring process

ML, a subfield of AI, focuses on designing algorithms that enable systems to learn from 
data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. These algo-
rithms identify patterns in data and adapt their performance over time. ML can be broadly 
categorized into supervised learning (Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil 2006) and unsupervised 
learning (Dike et al. 2018).

In supervised learning, models are trained using labeled data, where each input (X) is 
associated  with  a  corresponding  output  (Y).  The  model  learns  to  map  inputs  to  outputs, 
enabling it to classify or predict outcomes for new, unseen data. In contrast, unsupervised 
learning uses unlabeled data, where the model identifies patterns, similarities, or clusters 
without predefined output labels.

Various  ML  algorithms,  such  as  conventional  ML,  DL,  EL,  and  hybrid  models,  have 
gained significant attention due to their enhanced predictive capabilities in credit scoring 
tasks. The following sections explore the application and performance of these techniques 
in the context of credit scoring.

4.1  Traditional machine learning models

This section describes the conventional ML models used for credit scoring.

4.1.1  Logistic regression

LR is a well-established algorithm commonly used in credit scoring (Dastile et al. 2020). 
It is a probabilistic classification model that estimates the probability of a binary outcome 
(Atiya  2001).  It  is  particularly  valuable  in  credit  scoring  as  it  estimates  the  conditional 
probability of an input belonging to a particular class (default or non-default) (Ala’raj et al. 
2022). Given a feature vector x

Rd, the model computes (formula 1):

is the binary response variable (1 = default, 0 = non-default), β0 is the

are estimated by maximizing the log-likelihood function:

xi). This optimization is typically performed using iterative meth-

|

Its  simplicity,  good  performance  with  smaller  datasets,  and  robustness  against  noise 
make it a favored choice for credit scoring. However, the assumption of a linear relationship 
between inputs and log odds may not always hold, especially in cases where the relationship 
is nonlinear.

Cao et al. (2021) introduced a ML credit score and default probability model with LR 
showing  the  best  performance  in  5-fold  validation.  They  utilized  attribute  weighting  for 
feature  selection  based  on  information  ranking  and  recommended  focusing  on  recall  for 
imbalanced data. By setting an optimal probability threshold of 0.18 using Youden’s index, 
they improved TPR while reducing FNR achieving 86.58% accuracy.

Dumitrescu et al. (2022) introduced Penalized Logistic Tree Regression (PLTR), a power-
ful and interpretable credit scoring system. They enhanced LR using rules from short-depth 
DTs as predictors and enabled non-linear effects capture while retaining interpretability. The 
proposed method achieved the best AUC with 92.99%, 77.80%, and 90.11% in autralian, 
taiwan, and housing datasets respectively. The proposed PLTR improved credit risk predic-
tion of monte carlo simulations and real-world applications.

Ariza-Garzón  et  al.  (2020)  compared  the  LR  model  and  other  algorithms  such  as  RF, 
DT, and XGBoost for peer-to-peer lending scoring. XGBoost excelled in the default class 
though it ranked third in the non-default class with the highest precision. The study revealed 
that LR achieved the best accuracy (78.10%) and AUC (66.60%) on the lending club dataset 
compared  to  the  other  ML  models. Their  research  demonstrated  the  possibility  of  build-
ing accurate and transparent ML models. These models can win the trust of industry play-
ers, regulators, and end-users, especially in contexts where explainability is crucial in P2P 
lending.

4.1.2  Decision trees

DTs (Safavian and Landgrebe 1991) are supervised models used for both regression and 
classification tasks. The structure of the model mirrors that of a tree, with a root, branches, 
and leaves representing decisions made based on attribute values. DTs split data by select-
ing attributes that maximize information gain, forming a decision path until no further splits 
are possible (Aniceto et al. 2020). A key advantage of DTs is their interpretability, as they 
provide clear, understandable decision rules. They are also capable of capturing nonlinear 
relationships between features and the target variable, making them suitable for complex 
datasets. However, DTs can be highly sensitive to the training data, which leads to overfit-
ting or instability when the dataset changes slightly (Ariza-Garzón et al. 2020).

Syed Nor et al. (2019) developed a personal bankruptcy prediction model using the DT 
technique. The study defined bankruptcy as terminated members who failed to settle their 
loans,  using  a  sample  of  24,546  cases  with  17%  settled  and  83%  terminated.  The  data-
set included a dependent variable (bankruptcy status) and 12 predictors collected from an 
authorized debt management agency. The findings provided profiles of bankrupts, a reliable 
personal  bankruptcy  scoring  model  achieving  83.29%  accuracy,  06.62%  specificity,  and 
99.00% sensitivity, and identified significant variables on imbalanced data.

Khedr et al. (2021) developed a new predictive method for default customers’ loans using 
ML. The method utilized available personal data and historical credit data to evaluate the 
creditworthiness of customers for loans. The ABE dataset was used for training and testing, 
incorporating 10 features from the application form and i-score report class to assist credit 
officers in making informed decisions and avoiding random customer selection. The per-
formance of several classifiers was compared before and after feature selection. The results 
indicated that the DT classifier outperformed other classifiers with a significant prediction 
accuracy of almost 94.85% accuracy and 96.75% F1-score.

Maharjan  (2022)  applied  three  different  classifiers,  C4.5,  CART,  and  Naïve  Bayes,  to 
predict loan grants and attribute selection. Their research aimed to help financial institutions 
seek better strategies through credit scoring models. They concluded that categories 4 and 
8 were the best, while categories 3, 6, and 11 were the worst, as these had higher false posi-
tive values in all C4.5, CART, and Naïve Bayes testing. Among the classifiers, C4.5 was 
the best for predicting loans, achieving an 85.23% F1-score and 78.33% accuracy on the 
german loan dataset.

4.1.3  Random forest

RF  is  a  supervised  learning  model  that  aggregates  multiple  DTs  to  make  predictions  for 
classification and regression tasks. The core technique behind RF is bagging, or bootstrap 
aggregation, which involves resampling the training dataset with replacement to create mul-
tiple subsets. A DT is trained on each of these subsets and predictions are made based on a 
majority vote across all trees (Dastile et al. 2020). RF is known for its speed and simplicity, 
effectively handling high-dimensional data, and being less prone to overfitting compared to 
individual DTs (Teles et al. 2021). However, the reliance of the model on numerous trees 
can complicate the interpretability of its results.

Trivedi (2020) developed a credit scoring prediction model through the integration of 
various feature selection methods such as information gain, gain ratio, and chi-square and 
ML classifiers such as naïve bayes, RF, DT (C5.0), and SVM. Their proposed model proved 
the effectiveness of a combination of RF and chi-Square in achieving strong performance 
with  93.12%  accuracy  and  93.10%  F1-score  on  german  dataset.  However,  it  required  a 
slightly longer training time than other approaches.

Li  et  al.  (2021)  introduced  a  deep  forest  or  multi-grained  Cascade  Forest  (gcForest) 
model based on a RF algorithm. The gcForest efficiently processes high-dimensional fea-
ture information using multidimensional scanning and cascading. They created a two-stage 
hybrid default discrimination model by combining gcForest with multiple feature selection 
methods. The proposed model achieved the best accuracy (81.20%) and AUC (86.80%) on 
a german dataset.

Moscato  (2021)  conducted  a  benchmarking  analysis  of  prevalent  credit  risk  scoring 
models for predicting loan repayment in P2P platforms. Addressing class imbalance, they 
evaluated classifiers with various sampling strategies and selected RF, LR, and Multi-Layer-
Perceptron (MLP) combined with Random Under Sampling (RUS) and IHT. Among these, 
the RF-RUS combination demonstrated the most effective performance achieving 64.00% 
accuracy, 63.00% recall, and 71.70% AUC on the lending club dataset.

Aji and Dhini (2019) applied data mining to address non-performing loan issues focused 
on mortgage loans. Using a dataset from an Indonesian bank that provided mortgage loans, 
they used RF with AdaBoost classifiers. Their analysis indicated that the model achieved the 
best results with 72.95% accuracy, 73.00% recall, and 70.40% specificity.

Tran  et  al.  (2021)  developed  a  credit  scoring  method  in  vietnam.  They  employed 
machine-learning models such as LightGBM, CatBoost, and RF derived from their partici-
pation in the kalapa credit score challenge. Their evaluation ultimately determined RF as the 
best-performing model based on their experimental outcomes achieving 83.00% F1-score 
and 81.00% AUC on Kalapa dataset. In addition, this was the first model applied in the field 
of vietnamese banking.

Parvin  and  Saleena  (2020)  attempted  to  forecast  credit  scores  using  several  classifier 
models  (LR,  RF,  DT,  SVM,  K  nearest  neighbor,  naive  bayes,  extra  trees  classifier,  ada 
boosting, bagged DT, and MLP) and evaluated the effectiveness of each model using met-
rics. A comparison study was conducted to determine the best classifier for predicting credit 
scores. The experimental results showed that the RF model provided greater accuracy with 
88.41%, recall with 80.00%, precision with 87.00%, and F1-score with 84.00% on the aus-
tralian dataset.

Zhang et al. (2018) introduced a credit scoring model (NCSM) based on feature selection 
and grid search to optimize the RF algorithm. To improve prediction accuracy, the model 
lowered  the  influence  of  irrelevant  and  redundant  information.  Information  entropy  was 
regarded as the heuristic that was used to select the best feature in NCSM. The experimental 
results demonstrated that NCSM achieved 91.71% accuracy on the australian dataset and 
82.14% accuracy on the german dataset.

4.1.4  Support vector machine

SVM  is  a  supervised  learning  model  that  maps  data  into  a  high-dimensional  space  and 
separates it into two classes using a linear separator known as a hyperplane (Teles et al. 
2021). Commonly used for classification tasks, SVM identifies the optimal hyperplane by 
maximizing the margin between classes while minimizing the distance of the closest points 
(known as support vectors) from the boundary (Cervantes et al. 2020). Various kernels, such 
as linear, polynomial, radial basis function, and sigmoid can be applied to handle different 
data structures (Friedman et al. 1997). With the appropriate kernel, SVM is effective for 
both  linearly  and  non-linearly  separable  datasets.  However,  kernel  selection  significantly 
affects performance and may increase training time on large datasets (Huang et al. 2007).

Teles et al. (2021) applied credit scoring using collateral as an independent variable and 
compared SVM and RF models in forecasting the recovered credit value. The SVM model 
achieved a slightly higher classification accuracy (98.34%) compared to RF (98.20%) on a 
bank institution dataset.

Dm  and  Mm  (2018)  compared  loan  default  prediction  in  Kenya  using  SVM  and  LR 
models. The data was used from equity bank and split into training and test sets. The LR 
model showed an accuracy of 77.27% with the train data and 73.33% with the test data, and 
a precision of 84.40% and 82.44%, respectively. The SVM with a linear kernel model had 
an accuracy of 88.29% and 86.12% with the train and test data, respectively, and a precision 
of 87.85% and 78.31%. The SVM model outperformed the LR model, which led the study 
to recommend the use of SVM for loan default prediction in financial institutions.

Wang and Li (2019) improved credit assessment predictions using an SVM-based model. 
Recognizing that SVM performance heavily relies on parameter selection, they employed 
an Improved Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (IFOA) to optimize these parameters. The 
study  analyzed  P2P  loan  data  using  Linear  Regression,  Classical  SVM,  FOA-SVM,  and 
IFOA-SVM, finding that the IFOA-SVM model provided the most accurate predictions by 
achieving the best precision (93%).

4.1.5  K nearest neighbors

The K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (Guo et al. 2003) model is a non-parametric supervised 
learning  technique  that  functions  by  utilizing  two  parameters,  the  distance  function  and 
the selected k value, with performance based on the aforementioned factors. KNN initially 
calculates the distance between all data points and accumulates those that are near to it for 
any new data point. The algorithm uses a chosen distance function (such as Euclidean or 
Manhattan) to identify and group the nearest neighbors to the target data point. Next, it col-
lects a specified number of data points that have the shortest distance between them all and 
classify them based on their distance. However, because KNN calculates a distance metric 
for every data point during classification, it incurs higher computational demands which can 
be perceived as a drawback in terms of computational cost (Zhang et al. 2017).

Mukid et al. (2018) reviewed the Weighted K-Nearest Neighbor (WKNN) method for 
credit  assessment,  considering  the  use  of  various  kernel  functions.  The  research  utilized 
credit data from a private bank in indonesia. The results demonstrated that the gaussian ker-
nel and rectangular kernel significantly improved the performance of the WKNN method. 
Specifically, the gaussian and rectangular kernels achieved an accuracy of 82.40% and a 
very high sensitivity of 99.34%, though the specificity was relatively low (11.11%), which 
indicated that the model strongly favored identifying positive cases.

Loo et al. (2023) predicted the risk of loan default using various ML algorithms (LR, 
DT, RF, KNN, SVM, and naïve bayes) and compared these algorithms to identify the most 
suitable one for predicting loan default risk. In addition, they assisted the decision-makers 
in approving or rejecting loan requests in india. Using a dataset from kaggle focused on 
loan applicants in India, they analyzed behavior to determine risk. KNN emerged as the best 
model, scoring the highest in all evaluation metrics (accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score) 
with a score of 89%.

Pratiwi et al. (2019) applied the pseudo nearest neighbor (PNN) method to identify pro-
spective borrowers eligible for loan proposals. The study used historical credit data from 
a national bank in indonesia to focus on characteristics such as age, number of children, 
business duration, income, loan amount, and credit period. If a new borrower had charac-
teristics similar to a good historical borrower, the loan proposal was approved; otherwise, 
it was refused. The k-NN method achieved the best classification with k = 1, resulting in

the smallest error of 1.89%. The best classification for PNN was with k = 13, yielding the 
smallest error of 20.75%. Overall, k-NN proved to be more accurate for credit classification 
than PNN.

4.1.6  Hybrid and composite machine learning models

Hybrid and composite ML models integrate multiple algorithms to enhance predictive per-
formance  in  credit  scoring.  By  combining  supervised  and  unsupervised  techniques,  they 
overcome individual limitations and improve accuracy and robustness.

Unsupervised learning models are valuable in credit scoring for uncovering hidden pat-
terns in data. When used in hybrid models for feature selection (Tripathi et al. 2018) and 
segmentation (Boughaci et al. 2021), they improve prediction accuracy and provide essen-
tial inputs for supervised models, enhancing overall performance and discriminative power. 
Various studies have been proposed to prove the effectiveness of hybrid ML models in the 
credit scoring domain.

Goh et al. (2020) proposed a hybrid model that integrated Harmony Search (HS) for both 
feature selection and hyperparameter tuning. They introduced a Modified HS (MHS), incor-
porating elitism and exploration-exploitation strategies to improve efficiency. The combi-
nation  of  MHS  and  RF  (MHS-RF)  achieved  87.38%  accuracy  on  the  australian  dataset, 
offering improved explainability and computational efficiency (full results in Table 6).

Nalic  et  al.  (2020)  suggested  a  novel  hybrid  data  mining  model  that  combined  fea-
ture  selection  and  EL  methods.  They  utilized  various  preprocessing  techniques  and  five 
alternative feature selection algorithms integrating their results through innovative voting 
methods. The hybrid model using the IfAny voting method and the GLM + DT ensemble 
outperformed other classifiers by reaching 87.69% accuracy and 87.69% F1-score on a bos-
nia dataset.

Yao and Chen (2019) proposed a new hybrid RF-SVM ensemble model that used RF to 
select essential variables and ensemble methods to aggregate SVM as a robust classifier. 
The  testing  results  indicated  that  the  proposed  model  achieved  the  best  accuracy  on  the 
australian dataset with 87.94%, 83.85% recall, and 92.10% AUC. This model demonstrated 
promising effectiveness and potential for application in credit scoring.

Zhang  et  al.  (2021)  devised  a  credit-scoring  hybrid  ensemble  model  that  combined 
voting-based  outlier  detection  and  balanced  sampling.  Their  approach  aimed  to  enhance 
prediction  accuracy  by  reducing  noise  impact  during  classifier  training. They  introduced 
a weighted voting mechanism for outlier detection and employed bagging-based balanced 
sampling to address class imbalance. The effectiveness of the model was proved through 
experiments by achieving 99.77% and 99.71% F1-score on the creator dataset.

Tripathi et al. (2019) developed a hybrid model that improved credit scoring prediction 
through feature selection and a multilayer ensemble classifier framework. Their approach 
involved three phases: ranking and weighting classifiers, ensemble feature selection, and 
using selected features in a multilayer ensemble classifier architecture. Additionally, they 
introduced  a  Choquet  integral-based  classifier  placement  algorithm,  achieving  92.69% 
accuracy, 97.16% recall, and 88.46% specificity on the australian dataset.

Using unsupervised learning, Yuan et al. (2022) introduced a two-stage default predic-
tion  model  that  combined  k-means  clustering  for  sample  partitioning  and  support  vector 
domain description (SVDD) for credit scoring. The model utilized data from multi-temporal

data and demonstrated a five-year default prediction capability (AUC >0.85). The results 
(Table 6) showed that the proposed model achieved the best results on the real-world dataset 
achieving 86.33% AUC and 86.12% G-mean.

Boughaci et al. (2021) developed a hybrid method using clustering and RF techniques 
for credit scoring and financial bankruptcy prediction. They employed k-means clustering 
to group applicants and then applied RF to the clustered data. The results showed that the 
proposed model achieved the best results on taiwan dataset with 100% recall, 100% preci-
sion, and 100% F1-score. The approach improved classification performance and showed 
promise in applicant segmentation.

Suleiman et al. (2021) proposed a method for improving the discriminant capabilities of 
KNN and neural networks using unsupervised learning based on a SOM. The knowledge 
obtained by SOM was used as input to the subsequent pattern recognition models in the 
two-stage method. The results showed that the two-stage models improved the performance 
of  both  neural  networks  and  KNN  performances  achieving  96.30%  accuracy  with  SOM 
with  KNN  while  SOM  with  neural  networks  achieved  97.30%  accuracy  on  the  bank  of 
agriculture dataset.

Bao et al. (2019) proposed a unique strategy that combines unsupervised and supervised 
learning  for  credit  risk  assessment.  They  applied  unsupervised  techniques  in  consensus 
models like SOM at two stages: consensus formation and dataset clustering using k-means 
to  group  samples  by  presence  conditions.  Their  approach  outperformed  other  methods 
achieving 92.00% accuracy on the chinese P2P credit dataset.

Ibrahim  and  Olagunju  (2022)  introduced  a  two-stage  credit  scoring  model  employing 
SOM and CART. This approach fed the knowledge from clusters of SOM into CART for 
classification. Results from BOA’s Sokoto data showed enhancement and boosted the per-
formance of CART from 96.30% to 96.70%. This integration of SOM with CART outper-
formed the standalone CART model.

4.2  Deep learning models

DL (Hayashi 2022) is a subset of ML that is based on ANN with multiple layers between 
the input and output layers. These deep neural networks are powerful tools since they are 
capable of extracting intricate patterns and features from complex datasets automatically. 
This section describes DL models used for credit scoring.

4.2.1  Artificial neural network

ANN are computational DL models inspired by biological neurons. They consist of inter-
connected artificial neurons that can perform complex computations and adapt their struc-
tures based on external signals or information. A common architecture is a MLP consisting 
of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The training focuses on 
minimizing the loss function and refining predictions through weight and bias adjustments 
via backpropagation (Rumelhart et al. 1986). Despite their ability to automatically extract 
features and perform well on larger datasets, ANNs are considered a “Black Box” posing 
challenges in interpretation which is a crucial factor in credit scoring where transparency is 
vital (Ariza-Garzón et al. 2020).

Kazemi et al. (2023) proposed a method using a GA and neural networks to find optimal 
cut-off values based on performance metrics and the dataset. Their approach outperformed 
the standard threshold of 0.5 by achieving the highest accuracy with 91.91% and AUC with 
92.60% on the australian dataset which resulted in more accurate classifications.

Kazemi et al. (2021) introduced a hybrid method using a GA to optimize the structural 
parameters of a neural network classifier for enhanced accuracy. They applied this approach 
to the australian and german credit scoring datasets and achieved significant improvements: 
2.68% and 0.1% enhancements, respectively. The statistical analysis supported the effec-
tiveness of their algorithm in parameter tuning.

Diaconescu and Neagoe (2020) introduced a credit-scoring DL technique that defined 
credit score as the weighted sum of false negative errors and false positive mistakes. This 
model aimed for the lowest possible score emphasizing FN (low credit projected as good) 
to minimize the missed alarm rate across the total number of faults. Optimization methods 
were employed to select a deep-learning neural network architecture and hyperparameters 
for their approach and the model achieved 84.83% accuracy on the german dataset.

4.2.2  Convolutional neural networks

CNNs  are  deep  feedforward  neural  networks  that  have  been  widely  used  for  their  great 
capacity to extract local image information. Unlike traditional supervised learning meth-
ods, CNNs eliminate the need for manual feature extraction. They handle feature extraction 
and  description  during  the  learning  phase  and  aim  to  minimize  classification  errors. The 
architecture comprises convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers, each with specific 
processes for visual property extraction and classification (Rumelhart et al. 1986). The con-
volution layer uses filters for feature detection, pooling reduces image size while preserving 
key characteristics and the fully connected layer performs classification on flattened fea-
tures. While CNNs are standard for images, their direct application to structured credit data 
requires careful adaptation.

Dastile and Celik (2021) proposed an interpretable DL model for credit scoring to meet 
legal  decision-making  criteria. They  transformed  tabular  data  into  images  employing  2D 
CNNs. In their approach, each image pixel represented a feature from the tabular dataset. 
Their model was tested on three public credit scoring datasets achieving the best results on 
the australian dataset with 95.00% accuracy.

Zhu et al. (2018) proposed a model that combines CNN and the feature selection algo-
rithm relief. Experiments were carried out on a real-world dataset from a Chinese consumer 
finance company. The findings demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing 
benchmarks like LR and RF achieving 91.64% accuracy, 96.89% AUC, and 91.64% KS.

Neagoe et al. (2018) presented a new approach to applying and evaluating Deep CNN 
versus MLP for financial prediction. They designed a credit scoring model using two neural 
network  classifiers. A  MLP  with  eight  layers  and  a  DCNN  with  thirteen  layers.  Experi-
ments using the german and australian credit datasets evaluated model performance based 
on overall accuracy, false alarm rate, and missed alarm rate. The results demonstrated the 
effectiveness of the proposed approach, as the DCNN significantly outperformed the MLP 
in both datasets. For the german credit dataset, DCNN achieved an OA of 90.85%, com-
pared to MLP’s 81.20%. For the australian credit dataset, DCNN reached an OA of 99.74%, 
while MLP obtained 90.75%.

4.2.3  Long short-term memory network

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997) is a type 
of  recurrent  neural  network  designed  to  handle  variable  length  sequences.  Comprising 
LSTM units with input, output, and forget gates, these networks can remember values over 
extended periods. LSTM is employed to construct layers within neural networks (Yotsawat 
et al. 2021). The forget gate determines which parts of cell states are worth remembering 
based on the cell state passed on from the previous time step. While the input gate manages 
information flow to preserve pertinent data from irrelevant updates (Hochreiter 1998). The 
cell state gate calculates the new data to be stored in the memory cell and the output gate 
guides  the  actual  prediction  based  on  the  current  memory  cell.  LSTM  networks  excel  at 
capturing extended dependencies in sequential data. This makes them well-suited for credit 
risk assessment where historical features are essential (Ala’raj et al. 2022) and they auto-
matically  extract  relevant  features  without  extensive  manual  engineering.  However,  they 
often require a large amount of data to achieve good performance which can be challenging 
due to the privacy of the credit data.

Ala’raj et al. (2021) aimed to aid bank management in assessing credit card clients by 
predicting missed payments. Their model used bidirectional LSTM to calculate the likeli-
hood  of  missed  payments  for  each  customer  in  the  following  month.  The  scores  of  the 
model correlated with payment probabilities to enhance consumer credit scoring according 
to experimental results with 82.40% accuracy, 95.15% specificity, and 78.47% AUC on the 
non-transactional.

Wang et al. (2018) utilized borrowers’ online behavior data to create a consumer credit 
scoring method employing Attention Mechanism LSTM (AM-LSTM). They treated events 
as words, transformed them into vectors using the Event2vec model, and employed an atten-
tion mechanism LSTM network to predict user default likelihood. The results showed the 
effectiveness of the proposed model in achieving 71.00% AUC and 31.00% KS on the P2P 
lending platform dataset.

Ala’raj et al. (2022) employed DL to help bank management in credit card client scoring. 
They predicted consumer behavior across three dimensions: missed payments, purchasing 
behavior, and customer grouping based on mathematical expectations of loss. Two models 
named missed payment prediction LSTM and purchase estimation prediction LSTM were 
devised  to  enhance  decision-making  through  customer  behavioral  grouping.  The  experi-
ment was tested on the transactional dataset giving the best results with 90.69% accuracy, 
72.87% recall, 82.94% KS, and 91.00% AUC.

Adisa et al. (2022) applied LSTM for the financial domain which was rarely used for 
credit scoring prediction. Their research presented an optimization approach (GA) to deter-
mine the optimal parameters for the LSTM model, including epochs, batch size, number of 
neurons, learning rate, and dropout. The results showed that the optimized LSTM model 
outperformed  both  single  classifiers  and  ensemble  models  with  89.27%  accuracy  on  the 
australian dataset.

4.2.4  Hybrid deep learning models

Hybrid DL models combine multiple DL techniques or integrate traditional ML methods 
with DL approaches. Various studies have been proposed to prove the effectiveness of these 
models.

In  a  follow-up  study,  Pławiak  et  al.  (2020)  introduced  the  Deep  Genetic  Hierarchical 
Network of Learners (DGHNL) that combined evolutionary computation, EL, and DL. This 
approach applied to the statlog australian data featured a 16-layer genetic cascade ensemble 
of classifiers including SVMs, normalization methods, feature extraction, kernel functions, 
and parameter optimizations. Their proposed model holds potential for use in the banking 
system achieving 97.39% accuracy on the australian dataset.

Pławiak  et  al.  (2020)  introduced  the  Deep  Genetic  Hierarchical  Network  of  Learners 
(DGHNL)  that  combined  various  learners,  normalization  procedures,  feature  extraction 
methods, kernel functions, and parameter optimizations. Their approach incorporated DL, 
EL, genetic feature selection, and optimization, focusing on proper information flow and 
fusion within the DGHNL structure. The results showed the potential of the proposed model 
achieving 94.60% accuracy on the german dataset.

Shen  et  al.  (2021)  devised  a  novel  DL  ensemble  model  for  credit  risk  assessment  by 
addressing imbalanced credit data. They combined the LSTM network with the AdaBoost 
algorithm followed by an enhanced SMOTE method for data training. Experimental results 
indicated the superiority of their proposed model compared to other methods with 80.32% 
AUC and 39.48% KS on the german credit dataset.

4.3  Ensemble learning models

EL (Dong et al. 2020) is a powerful ML technique that warrants separate examination. This 
approach involves the integration of multiple learning algorithms to enhance predictive per-
formance by combining the strengths of diverse models. This section describes EL models 
used for credit scoring.

4.3.1  Gradient boosting decision trees

Gradient  Boosting  Decision  Trees  (GBDT)  is  an  ensemble  ML  method  that  is  widely 
employed in both classification and regression tasks. The gradient boosting concept involves 
combining weak base learners often DTs with high bias and low variance to craft a robust 
and accurate model. GBDT extends the boosting approach by employing a boosting-based 
error minimization strategy to generate models additively (Liu et al. 2021). The model con-
tinues to add trees until a predefined number of trees are built, the loss reaches an accept-
able level, or a specified stopping criterion is met. GBDT models can be computationally 
expensive when dealing with deep trees or complex problems, often consuming a significant 
amount of memory (Friedman 2001).

Liu  et  al.  (2021)  proposed  a  multi-grained  and  multi-layered  gradient-boosting  deci-
sion tree (GBDT) for credit scoring. This approach combined the representation learning 
capability of neural networks with the robustness of ensemble-based methods. Then, they 
explored the hierarchical representation learning ability of the proposed method. Finally, 
they enhanced the representation ability of the multi-layered framework by incorporating a

---

multigrained scanning mechanism. The model achieved favorable results (88.26% accuracy 
and 94.07% AUC on the australian dataset) by minimizing intra-class distance and increas-
ing inter-class distance.

Zou  and  Gao  (2022)  developed  a  supervised  NN-based  augmented  GBDT-AugBoost-
ELM  for  enhanced  credit  scoring. This  approach  utilized  bagging  ensemble  training  and 
boosting ensemble optimization to diversify base learners. The proposed method was tested 
on several public datasets (table 6) and achieved the best results on the japanese dataset with 
86.87% accuracy and 87.91% F1-score.

Bai et al. (2022) proposed a non-parametric ensemble tree model called Gradient Boost-
ing Survival Tree (GBST) to handle heterogeneous industrial data from the chinese con-
sumer financing sector. GBST extended traditional survival tree models by incorporating 
gradient  boosting  to  optimize  survival  probabilities  over  time.  This  approach  effectively 
minimized  total  error  and  proved  its  superiority  in  estimating  credit  risk  by  achieving 
82,51% AUC and 51,64% KS on the 360 finance dataset.

Zhang  et  al.  (2020)  introduced  a  P2P  lending  online  integrated  credit  scoring  model 
(OICSM) that combined a GBDT with a neural network. OICSM improved credit scoring 
by handling two types of features and enabling online updates. Tests using real credit data-
sets from the US and china validated the effectiveness of OICSM achieving the best results 
by 73.39% AUC on the lending club dataset and 71.76% AUC on the paipaidai dataset. Its 
advantage in DL and online dynamic update capability contributed to its significant perfor-
mance improvement.

4.3.2  The extreme gradient boosting

XGBoost model is an ensemble model that combines tree models with gradient boosting. A 
tree model is a type of supervised model that partitions explanatory variables to best clas-
sify the response variable and generates decision trees in parallel (Nobre and Neves 2019). 
Boosting is a reinforcement algorithm that progressively adds model iterations by adjust-
ing the weights of the weak learners (trees) to minimize error iteration after iteration. Each 
subsequent tree attempts to reduce the errors introduced by the previous tree. This reduces 
model bias and improves overall accuracy (Ampountolas et al. 2021). XGBoost not only 
improves  tree  models  by  improving  classification  performance,  but  it  is  also  faster  than 
tree model algorithms. In addition, XGBoost is an advanced gradient-boosting model that 
mitigates overfitting by carefully balancing the reduction of the objective function and the 
complexity of the model (Ariza-Garzón et al. 2020).

Ampountolas  et  al.  (2021)  evaluated  ML  algorithms  on  microlending  data  to  classify 
borrowers into credit categories. They highlighted the success of using customer data and 
off-the-shelf  classifiers  like  the  XGBoost  algorithm.  The  model  achieved  88.00%  recall, 
71.00% specificity, and 78.00% F1-score on the micro-loans dataset. This approach offers 
a  dependable  and  cost-effective  way  for  developing-world  micro-lending  institutions  to 
assess creditworthiness without relying on credit history or centralized databases.

Xia et al. (2021) proposed a novel dynamic credit scoring model, SurvXGBoost, which 
combines survival analysis with the GBDT approach. This model aimed to improve predict-
ability for personal default over time and addresses censoring issues. Compared to bench-
mark models on a real-world consumer loan dataset, SurvXGBoost achieved an AUC of 
68.08%. The results of out-of-sample (68.07% AUC) and out-of-time validation (67.07%

---

AUC) indicated that SurvXGBoost outperformed the benchmarks in terms of predictability 
and misclassification cost (64.84%). SurvXGBoost maintained interpretability by providing 
information on feature importance.

Yotsawat et al. (2021) proposed an improved credit scoring model based on XGBoost 
classifier  using  bayesian  hyper-parameters  optimization  (XGBoost-BO).  The  model 
involved two steps: data pre-processing to handle missing values and scale the data, fol-
lowed by bayesian hyper-parameter optimization to tune the XGBoost classifier. The model 
was evaluated on four public datasets (german, australian, lending club, and polish). Sev-
eral  state-of-the-art  classification  algorithms  were  used  for  predictive  comparison.  The 
results showed that the proposed model improved accuracy by 4.10%, 3.03%, and 2.76% 
on the german, lending club, and australian datasets, respectively. The experimental results 
confirmed that the XGBoost-BO model was suitable for assessing the creditworthiness of 
applicants.

4.3.3  Hybrid ensemble learning models

Similar  to  hybrid  machine  and  DL  models,  hybrid  EL  models  represent  an  innovative 
approach that combines the strengths of different ensemble techniques or integrating them 
with other ML methods. The development of these models has shown promising results, 
particularly in enhancing predictive accuracy and robustness in complex datasets.

He  et  al.  (2018)  developed  a  novel  ensemble  model  for  credit  scoring  that  addressed 
the imbalance ratio dataset. Their algorithm modified BalanceCascade for balanced subsets 
and utilized RF and XGBoost classifiers in a three-stage ensemble. Stacking generated new 
features from the first layer’s outcomes for the second layer optimized via particle swarm 
optimization.  The  suggested  model  demonstrated  its  superiority  in  the  japanease  dataset 
achieving 88.04% F1-score, 92.79% AUC, 86.22% G-mean, and 75.80% KS.

Rofik et al. (2024) proposed a credit risk assessment model that integrates SMOTE for 
class  imbalance  treatment  and  stacking  EL  to  enhance  prediction  performance. The  base 
learners in their stacking framework include RF, SVM, Extra Trees Classifier, with XGBoost 
serving as the meta-learner. The study followed a structured pipeline involving data collec-
tion, preprocessing, oversampling, modeling, and evaluation, and used the German Credit 
dataset with cross-validation. Results demonstrated strong performance with an accuracy of 
83.21%, precision of 79.29%, recall of 91.78%, and an F1-score of 85.08%, highlighting 
the effectiveness of combining SMOTE with stacking techniques for credit scoring tasks.

Zhang et al. (2021) introduced a unique multi-stage ensemble model with outlier adap-
tation  to  improve  credit  scoring.  They  enhanced  the  local  outlier  factor  algorithm  using 
bagging for noisy credit data. Their approach also included a novel feature transformation 
method,  stacking-based  EL,  and  self-adaptive  parameter  optimization.  Experiments  con-
firmed  the  enhanced  performance  of  the  model  by  achieving  93.16%  accuracy,  93.45% 
F1-score, and 96.95% AUC on the japanese dataset.

Jin et al. (2021) introduced a multi-stage ensemble model with a hybrid GA for accurate 
credit prediction. They addressed data imbalance using the VIHT technique and developed 
a hybrid GA for selecting features and classifier subsets. The model utilized stacking for 
final predictions and demonstrated its effectiveness by achieving 93.79% recall and 15.76% 
F1-score through experiments on the unbalanced polish 2 credit dataset.

Yotsawat et al. (2021) introduced a Cost-sensitive Neural Network Ensemble (CS-NNE) 
for credit scoring. Their novel approach applied multiple class weights to address imbal-
anced classes and enhance diversity among base  neural networks. The results in Table 6 
demonstrated  that  CS-NNE  outperformed  single  neural  networks  on  real-world  imbal-
anced  credit  datasets  effectively  addressing  imbalance  problems  and  surpassing  existing 
approaches achieving the highest accuracy (91.30%) on the polish dataset.

Shen et al. (2019) introduced an innovative ensemble model for assessing personal credit 
risk by integrating SMOTE and classifier optimization. They rebalanced the training dataset 
with SMOTE by optimizing back propagation neural networks using particle swarm optimi-
zation and built an ensemble model combining optimized back propagation neural network 
classifiers with AdaBoost. The results presented in table 6 showed that the model achieved 
the best on the australian dataset with 90.58% accuracy, 95.40% F1-score, 91.03% AUC, 
and 90.94% G-mean.

Jiao et al. (2021) introduced an advanced ensemble model to enhance image feature clas-
sification. Their approach combined a CNN for feature extraction and an XGBoost classifier 
for classification. They optimized the model using an improved particle swarm optimization 
algorithm to fine-tune hyperparameters. The results on the image and credit dataset in table 
6  showed  the  model’s  superior  performance  achieving  the  best  results  on  the  australian 
dataset with 88.20% accuracy and 87.43% F1-score.

Chen  et  al.  (2020)  proposed  a  unique  ensemble  model  using  the  generalized  shapley 
value and the choquet integral. They utilized fuzzy measures to capture interactions among 
base learners using a linear programming model. Representing base learner-predicted val-
ues with fuzzy numbers preserved original information. The ensemble model’s anticipated 
value was computed using the Generalized Shapley Choquet Integral (GSCI) aggregation 
operator. Their GSCI-based ensemble credit scoring approach yielded robust results achiev-
ing the best values with 94.53% recall, 90.91% F1-score, and 91.43% AUC on the australian 
dataset while the best accuracy was 93.35% on the RRDai dataset.

Zhang  and  Chi  (2021)  introduced  a  novel  heterogeneous  ensemble  credit  scoring 
approach to address imbalanced data classification. Their model incorporated LSVM, KNN, 
MDA, DT, and LR classifiers and adaptively selected the highest AUC base classifiers based 
on data distribution. Merging these base classifiers yielded predictions that outperformed 
baseline  models  by  achieving  70.50% AUC  on  the  chilean  dataset.  It  made  it  useful  for 
actual credit scoring to manage credit risk for financial institutions.

Xing  et  al.  (2024)  proposed  a  stacked  ensemble  model  integrating  Random  Forest, 
XGBoost,  and TabNet  to  enhance  credit  score  prediction.  By  leveraging  the  strengths  of 
these high-performance models, particularly the DL capabilities of TabNet, the approach 
addresses limitations of individual classifiers. The ensemble was evaluated using multiple 
metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC, and demonstrated superior perfor-
mance on the Credit Score dataset.

Li  et  al.  (2022)  introduced  the  One-class  Classification  Driven  Dynamical  Ensemble 
Learning  (OCDDEL)  approach.  Unlike  using  inferred  labels,  OCDDEL  solely  relied  on 
accepted  applications  and  their  genuine  labels.  It  formed  a  dynamic  ensemble  model  to 
handle diverse test applications. By training a one-class classifier, OCDDEL grouped test 
applications and computed ensemble weights for each case based on similarity with training 
applicants. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model by achieving 
89.38% accuracy on the lending club dataset.

Guo  et  al.  (2019)  introduced  a  novel  self-adaptive  classifier  ensemble  model  utiliz-
ing  statistics  and  ML  techniques  to  enhance  prediction  performance.  Their  multi-stage 
approach included data preparation, self-adaptive selection of base classifiers with bayesian 
optimization-adjusted parameters, and integration of these optimized base classifiers using 
multi-layer stacking. Testing on real-world credit datasets demonstrated the model’s strong 
performance on the australian dataset with 87.40% accuracy, 86.80% F1-score, and 94.00% 
AUC.

Tripathi et al. (2018) aimed to merge feature selection and ensemble frameworks. They 
suggested utilizing feature clustering technique k-means for selection. They then used this 
reduced dataset with five base classifiers. Aggregating the outputs through weighted voting 
improved the final prediction. They tested this on three datasets and compared it to existing 
methods and proved the efficiency of the proposed method by achieving the best results with 
87.98% accuracy and 90.69% F1-score on the japanese dataset.

5  Performance evaluation criteria

Selecting appropriate performance evaluation metrics is a critical task in credit scoring, as 
each metric has its own strengths and limitations (Hand 2009). Certain models may excel 
under specific criteria but perform poorly under others (Guetari et al. 2023; Gicic and Subasi 
2019), making the choice of metric crucial for an accurate assessment.

A widely used approach is the confusion matrix (Table 2), which categorizes predictions 
into true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. This foundation sup-
ports several derived metrics commonly employed in model evaluation.

Accuracy  (formula  3),  though  intuitive,  can  be  misleading  with  imbalanced  datasets. 
Precision (formula 4) and recall (formula 5) offer deeper insight into model behavior, par-
ticularly in identifying relevant positive cases. The F1-score (formula 6) combines these two 
into a single metric, especially useful under class imbalance.

Accuracy =

T P + T N
T P + T N + F P + F N

P recision =

T P
T P + F P

Recall =

T P
T P + F N

F 1–Score = 2

P recision
Recall
P recision + Recall

The  Receiver  Operating  Characteristic  (ROC)  curve  graphically  illustrates  the  trade-off 
between  sensitivity  and  specificity  across  various  thresholds.  Its  summary  statistic,  the 
Area Under the Curve (AUC), reflects the overall ability of a model to distinguish between 
classes.

Additional comprehensive metrics include the Geometric Mean (G-Mean), which bal-
ances sensitivity and specificity (formula 7), and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) statistic, 
widely used in credit scoring to measure the model’s discriminatory power.

6  Results

6.1  Study selection and PRISMA flow diagram

A total of 345 studies were identified through database searches and backward snowballing. 
After  removing  duplicates  and  applying  inclusion  criteria,  63  primary  studies  published 
between 2018 and 2024 were included in the final synthesis (Fig. 1). These studies comprise 
48 journal articles (79%) and 13 conference papers (21%) and reflect a broad global contri-
bution from both academic and industrial institutions.

6.2  Study characteristics and summary tables

The 63 included studies were categorized into three main groups: traditional ML, DL, and 
EL,  including  hybrid  approaches  within  each  category.  The  most  frequently  used  public 
datasets were German, Australian, and Japanese credit datasets, while about one-third of 
studies relied on proprietary institutional datasets.

Tables 4, 5, and 6 summarize all studies, highlighting the models, datasets, and evalua-

tion metrics, providing a foundation for comparative analysis in the next section.

6.3  Performance analysis of reviewed studies

A comparative synthesis of performance metrics was conducted across the reviewed studies. 
Among these metrics, accuracy and AUC are the most frequently reported together across 
the  reviewed  studies.  This  is  because  accuracy  provides  an  overall  correctness  measure,

while AUC reflects the model’s ability to distinguish between classes, which is critical for 
imbalanced credit scoring datasets.

To further understand the comparative performance of different ML models, Tables 7 to 
10 present the accuracy and AUC results reported in selected studies using the most com-
mon benchmark datasets: German, Australian, Japanese, and Lending Club datasets.

Across the German dataset (Table 7), the GA + NN model (Kazemi et al. 2023) achieved 
the highest accuracy (91.91%) and AUC (92.60%), followed by ensemble approaches such 
as AugBoost-ELM (Zou and Gao 2022) and gcForest (Li et al. 2021). On the Australian and 
Japanese datasets (Tables 8, 9), Zhang et al.’s multi-stage ensemble (Zhang et al. 2021) con-
sistently outperformed other methods, achieving accuracies above 91% and AUCs above 
96%. For the Lending Club dataset (Table 10), the GSCI model (Chen et al. 2020) led per-
formance with 91.70% accuracy and 93.78% AUC.

Overall, hybrid and EL approaches, particularly those integrating neural networks, opti-
mization algorithms, or boosting, demonstrated consistently superior performance. Tradi-
tional models like logistic regression or standard SVMs, while occasionally competitive, 
generally  exhibited  lower  discrimination,  highlighting  the  advantage  of  advanced  hybrid 
architectures in credit scoring under imbalanced or noisy datasets.

6.3.1  Visual comparison of model performance

To complement the tabular summary of model performance, Figs. 2, 3, and 4 illustrate the 
comparative accuracy (± standard deviation) of ML, DL, and EL models in credit scoring. 
These plots provide a visual representation of variability across studies and highlight the 
models that consistently achieve high predictive performance.

Figures 2, 3 and 4 show that all three families of models achieve relatively high predic-
tive accuracy, with most methods consistently above 80%. ML models demonstrate strong 
performance, with Random Forest and the proposed hybrid ML approaches achieving the 
highest accuracies. DL models, such as CNN and hybrid DL configurations, provide robust 
performance with lower variability, indicating their ability to handle complex, high-dimen-
sional credit data. EL models, particularly XGB-BO and the proposed ensemble, capture 
peak performance in certain studies, although with slightly higher variability. Overall, these 
visualizations support the tabular findings, emphasizing that hybrid and ensemble architec-
tures offer top performance, while DL ensures stable outcomes and classical ML models 
remain reliable benchmarks.

6.4  Theoretical contributions from scientific mapping

To analyze the intellectual structure of the credit scoring literature, we applied science map-
ping methods using VOSviewer (Van Eck and Waltman 2010), conducting two complemen-
tary analyses: bibliographic coupling and keyword co-occurrence.

6.4.1  Bibliographic coupling

Bibliographic  coupling  identified  three  main  conceptual  clusters  among  the  reviewed 
studies:

● Cluster 1: classification models, credit scoring, ML, neural networks
 ● Cluster 2: credit analysis, gradient methods, multi-model approaches
 ● Cluster 3: explainable AI, credit score prediction, model interpretability
 ● Cluster 4: ensemble models, novel applications, multi-stage frameworks
 ● Cluster 5: DL, predictive modeling
 ● Cluster 6: feature selection and engineering

These clusters highlight key research trends, including the adoption of hybrid and EL meth-
ods, DL techniques, explainable AI, and feature engineering. Figure 6 presents the corre-
sponding keyword co-occurrence map.

title
ML for credit scoring: Improving 
logistic regression with non-linear 
decision-tree effects
A novel ensemble method for credit 
scoring: Adaption of different imbal-
ance ratios
A benchmark of ML approaches for 
credit score prediction
A new DL ensemble credit risk evalua-
tion model with an improved synthetic 
minority oversampling technique
Integration of unsupervised and 
supervised ML algorithms for credit 
risk assessment

Dumitrescu et al. (2022) introduced the penalised logistic tree regression (PLTR), com-
bining decision tree rules with logistic regression to enhance accuracy while maintaining 
interpretability. He et al. (2018) proposed an ensemble model that adapts to varying class 
imbalance  ratios  using  BalanceCascade,  random  forest,  XGBoost,  stacking,  and  particle 
swarm  optimization,  influencing  subsequent  studies  addressing  data  imbalance.  Moscato 
(2021) conducted a benchmarking study of widely used ML models for peer-to-peer lend-
ing,  assessing  both  predictive  performance  and  interpretability  through  explainable  AI. 
Shen et al. (2021) combined an improved SMOTE method with LSTM and AdaBoost in a 
DL ensemble framework, achieving strong performance on imbalanced datasets. Bao et al. 
(2019) demonstrated that integrating unsupervised learning at the consensus and clustering 
stages with supervised models significantly improves performance, underscoring the value 
of hybrid learning strategies in credit risk assessment.

6.6  Variables and feature selection

The reviewed studies employed a wide range of input variables, which we grouped into four 
main categories, reflecting the different aspects of borrower information:

● Demographic variables: age, sex, marital status, employment type, number of depend-
ents, and residence type (such as own, rent). These variables describe the personal back-

---

<!-- PAGE 37 -->

Page 37 of 54  13

ground of the borrower.

● Financial variables: annual income, loan amount, debt-to-income ratio, monthly loan 
payments, number of existing credit lines, and account balances. These indicate the bor-
rower’s current financial status and obligations.

● Behavioral variables: payment history, delinquency counts, credit utilization ratio, pre-
vious  defaults,  and  loan  repayment  behavior. These  variables  capture  the  borrower’s 
past creditworthiness and financial behavior (Bhandary et al. 2023).

● Transaction-level variables: recent credit inquiries, number of open accounts, new cred-
it lines opened, and overdraft history, representing recent financial activity and credit 
engagement.

These categories encompass the most commonly used variables in popular credit scoring 
datasets such as the German, Australian, and Japanese datasets, which formed a significant 
part of the reviewed literature.

Feature selection techniques were frequently employed to enhance model performance 
by  identifying  the  most  relevant  variables  and  reducing  noise.  Commonly  used  methods 
include:

● Information Gain (Lenka et al. 2022; Trivedi 2020)
 ● Gain Ratio (Trivedi 2020)
 ● Chi-square (Trivedi 2020)
 ● PCA (Lenka et al. 2022)
 ● GA (Lenka et al. 2022)
 ● Attribute Weighting (Cao et al. 2021)
 ● HS integrated for feature selection (Goh et al. 2020)
 ● Relief-based feature selection (Zhu et al. 2018)
 ● K-means clustering applied as a feature clustering technique for selection (Tripathi et al.

2018)

These techniques serve to improve input quality by selecting or transforming features, ulti-
mately leading to better predictive accuracy in credit scoring models.

7  Discussion

This section discusses the findings of the systematic review in relation to the five research 
questions  defined  in  the  methodology.  It  synthesizes  the  evidence  regarding  the  most 
commonly used ML models, their strengths and limitations, evaluation practices, emerg-
ing trends, and key challenges in credit scoring. In addition to addressing these questions,

7.1  RQ1: What are the most widely used ML models for credit scoring?

The most frequently applied ML models in credit scoring are detailed in Sect. 4. Tables 4, 5, 
and 6 provide an overview of conventional ML, DL, and ensemble models, along with the 
datasets and evaluation metrics reported across the reviewed studies.

Analysis  of  the  reviewed  studies  indicates  that  hybrid  ensemble  models  are  the  most 
widely used, reflecting their ability to combine multiple algorithms, leverage complemen-
tary strengths, improve predictive accuracy, and manage heterogeneous borrower profiles. 
Conventional ML models, such as LR, DTs, and SVM, remain relevant, particularly when 
interpretability and simplicity are prioritized. DL models, while promising for large-scale 
or high-dimensional datasets, are less frequently adopted due to their data-intensive nature 
and limited interpretability.

Overall, the evidence suggests that practitioners prioritize hybrid ensemble approaches 
when  predictive  performance  is  critical,  whereas  conventional  ML  models  are  preferred 
when transparency or smaller datasets are considered.

7.2  RQ2: What are the strengths and limitations of ML models used for credit 
scoring?

ML models exhibit various strengths and limitations when applied to credit scoring. Under-
standing these factors is essential for assessing their suitability in financial decision-mak-
ing.  The  following  subsections  detail  the  key  strengths  and  weaknesses  identified  in  the 
literature.

7.2.1  Strengths of machine learning models

A major strength of ML models is their ability to generate accurate predictions by learning 
patterns in historical data that reflect applicant behavior over time.

Many ML workflows include automated feature selection methods, reducing the need for 
manual engineering and potentially uncovering novel predictive features. This automation 
enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the credit scoring process. For example, DTs 
are particularly effective for small datasets, providing both reliable predictions and inter-
pretability, which is essential for regulatory compliance.

DL models are well-suited for large datasets due to their ability to automatically capture 
complex, non-linear relationships that traditional models often fail to identify. Their abil-
ity to handle high-dimensional data enables capturing subtle interactions among features, 
which  can  significantly  improve  predictive  performance  in  scenarios  with  complex  bor-
rower profiles.

EL models enhance predictive performance in credit scoring by aggregating the outputs 
of multiple base models, thereby reducing both bias and variance, especially when handling 
heterogeneous borrower profiles. Evidence from the reviewed studies shows that ensemble 
methods, particularly random forests and XGBoost, consistently achieve higher accuracy 
and AUC scores than single classifiers, indicating their widespread preference in practical 
credit scoring applications.

Hybrid models are another effective approach, integrating multiple algorithms to capture 
diverse patterns and relationships in the data, thereby improving predictive accuracy and

robustness. They can also be customized for specific datasets and problems by selecting the 
most suitable algorithms, making them highly adaptable to different credit scoring scenar-
ios. The flexibility of hybrid models allows financial institutions to tailor models to specific 
borrower segments, supporting more nuanced risk assessment strategies.

7.2.2  Limitations of machine learning models

Despite their strengths, ML models exhibit several limitations, particularly in credit scor-
ing applications. One major challenge is their reliance on high-quality labeled data, which 
is often difficult to obtain due to confidentiality and privacy concerns. Inadequate feature 
extraction and low-quality labeled data can significantly degrade the performance of con-
ventional  learning  models,  as  illustrated  by  the  limited  effectiveness  of  DL  models  with 
simpler architectures.

Model interpretability is another critical issue, particularly with complex ML techniques 
such as DL. Despite their impressive accuracy, these models are often regarded as black 
boxes, making their decisions difficult to interpret and raising transparency concerns. This 
challenge complicates the ability of lenders and borrowers to understand the model’s logic. 
Moreover, DL models are highly sensitive to the quality and quantity of training data which 
makes them susceptible to bias, especially with imbalanced datasets. While techniques like 
SMOTE  address  data  imbalance,  they  require  careful  handling  to  avoid  overfitting  and 
ensure robust performance.

The limited adoption of DL models in credit scoring may stem from their complexity 
and lack of interpretability, especially compared to traditional and ensemble methods. The 
fewer articles focusing on DL for credit scoring than other ML techniques underscore this 
limitation. While ensemble models can enhance the performance of credit scoring models, 
they may reduce interpretability compared to single models. The complexity of interpreting 
ensemble models with multiple classifiers can be a significant drawback.

Similarly,  integrating  multiple  models  in  hybrid  techniques  increases  the  complex-
ity  of  model  construction,  tuning,  and  validation. This  added  complexity  often  results  in 
higher computational overhead and extended development times. Moreover, hybrid models 
demand substantial computational resources due to the integration of multiple algorithms. 
Such resource intensity may hinder the scalability, practicality, and interpretability of hybrid 
techniques, particularly for smaller institutions with constrained computational capabilities. 
Hybrid models may also suffer from overfitting, particularly when combining complex or 
deeply nested architectures.

7.2.3  Synthesis and practical implications

Overall, the literature indicates that ensemble and hybrid ML models are the most widely 
used and effective approaches for credit scoring, largely due to their superior predictive per-
formance and ability to handle heterogeneous datasets. DL models offer high potential for 
large, high-dimensional datasets but are constrained by interpretability and data availability 
issues. For practitioners, this suggests a strategic approach: use ensemble or hybrid models 
where predictive performance is critical and data availability is sufficient, while balancing 
interpretability requirements to satisfy regulatory and operational needs.

From a research perspective, these findings highlight the need to develop methods that 
maintain the accuracy of complex models while improving interpretability and robustness. 
Techniques  such  as  explainable AI  and  careful  data  preprocessing  are  practical  solutions 
that bridge the gap between predictive power and transparency.

In summary, understanding these strengths and limitations not only informs model selec-
tion but also guides the implementation of ML-based credit scoring systems that are accu-
rate, fair, and operationally feasible.

7.3  RQ3: What metrics are used to evaluate machine learning credit scoring 
models?

The evaluation of ML models in credit scoring relies on a variety of metrics, as summarized 
in Sect. 5 and Table 3. Accuracy remains the most commonly reported metric, reflecting its 
intuitive appeal. However, its reliability is limited in imbalanced datasets, which are com-
mon in credit scoring. Metrics such as AUC, F1-score, G-Mean, and KS are frequently used 
to address this limitation, providing a more balanced assessment of model performance and 
better reflecting the ability to correctly identify risky borrowers.

The diversity of metrics reported across studies indicates both the complexity of credit 
scoring tasks and the absence of standardized evaluation protocols, making direct compari-
sons across models challenging. In practice, combining multiple metrics is essential to cap-
ture different aspects of performance, including overall predictive accuracy, minority-class 
detection, and discriminatory power. These trends suggest that researchers and practitioners 
recognize the importance of comprehensive evaluation to ensure models are both accurate 
and reliable in real-world credit risk assessment.

7.4  RQ4: What are the emerging trends and advances in ML models for credit 
scoring?

The field of credit scoring has seen significant trends and advancements with the integration 
of  ML  techniques  that  promise  to  reshape  traditional  paradigms. These  innovations  seek 
to augment the predictive capabilities and efficiency of credit scoring models, ultimately 
striving towards more inclusive and robust financial practices promoting more inclusive and 
robust financial practices.

7.4.1  Use of alternative data in credit scoring

Using alternative data in credit scoring is an emerging trend that enhances predictive accu-
racy by incorporating non-traditional data sources (Niu et al. 2019). Instead of relying solely 
on  traditional  financial  data,  alternative  data  allows  for  the  analysis  of  diverse  informa-
tion from platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google, as well as from mobile phone 
usage data. Psychometric assessments are emerging as new tools for evaluating borrower 
creditworthiness through alternative credit scoring models. This trend is particularly valu-
able for borrowers lacking sufficient financial history or considered too risky by traditional 
models.  It  provides  lenders  with  alternative  indicators  to  assess  borrower  behavior  and 
creditworthiness.

---

These trends reflect a dual emphasis in current credit scoring research: improving predic-
tive accuracy with novel data and models, while ensuring transparency and interpretability 
for regulatory compliance and ethical lending.

Various  studies  have  demonstrated  the  effectiveness  of  using  alternative  data  sources 
such as social media, mobile phone usage, and psychometric assessments to improve credit 
scoring models.

De  Cnudde  et  al.  (2019)  enhanced  traditional  credit  scoring  models  by  incorporating 
Facebook data. They categorized relationships into Look-A-likes (LAL), friends, and Best 
Friends Forever (BFF). BFFs displayed stronger predictive value than friends, while inter-
est-driven LAL data surpassed social network data showing the promising future of face-
book data in microfinance.

Yu et al. (2020) addressed “real but false data” challenges in credit assessment using dou-
ban’s social media data. Their criteria-driven data cleansing, including activity and network 
ratios,  led  to  significant  credit  score  rank  changes. This  work  contributed  to  trustworthy 
credit evaluation from social media data, helping to mitigate risks in the internet finance 
sector.

Niu et al. (2019) investigated using borrowers’ mobile phone-derived social network data 
for loan default prediction. LR and ML methods (RF, AdaBoost, LightGBM) confirmed the 
significant correlation of the data with loan default and its potential to enhance credit scor-
ing accuracy.

Kulkarni and Dhage (2019) introduced the “Information Trustworthiness” credit scoring 
system to fuse legacy and emotional/social scores. By leveraging social media interactions 
and  reliable  data  sources,  this  system  enhances  accuracy.  The  resulting  advanced  credit 
score considers personality traits effectively distinguishing default history and non-users, 
surpassing traditional methods. The use of these alternative datasets aligns with the evolu-
tion of credit scoring methodologies reflecting the progressive nature of the advancements 
in the field.

For the use of mobile phone data, Shema (2019) demonstrated that precise credit scor-
ing models could be built using airtime recharge data, a less invasive option for the privacy 
of borrowers. Testing against traditional models using loan data, their approach performed 
equally well and suggested the potential for digital lenders to enhance credit scoring while 
respecting privacy.

Ots et al. (2020) highlighted the practicality of using mobile phone usage data for credit 
scoring with a small dataset of 2,503 customers. Employing diverse classification methods, 
they achieved a 62% AUC in predicting payment behavior. This approach is particularly 
valuable for smaller companies lacking access to extensive datasets.

Óskarsdóttir  et  al.  (2020)  proposed  a  smartphone-based  microlending  as  a  means  to 
enhance financial inclusion. Their approach refined credit scoring models by engineering 
user data into pseudo-social networks and merging network analysis and ML. Ethical con-
siderations guided this methodology and offered the potential to elevate micro-lending app 
performance and extend global financial access.

Typically, psychometrics is used to evaluate mental, behavioral, and cognitive traits. The 
rationale behind incorporating them into credit scoring lies in their potential to reveal cer-
tain personality characteristics that might offer insights into an individual’s propensity to 
fulfill financial obligations (Djeundje et al. 2021).

Sifrain  (2020)  examined  the  Entrepreneurial  Financial  Lab  (EFL)  psychometric  test 
credit scoring model in microfinance using Sogesol. They found the EFL tool outperformed 
the existing model of Sogesol, though the psychometric model showed limited predictive 
power.  Introducing  a  new  credit  scoring  model  with  socio-economic  and  behavioral  fac-
tors improved performance. They suggested enhancing credit risk management potential at 
Sogesol.

Rabecca et al. (2018) investigated adding psychometric testing to the credit scoring sys-
tem, alongside demographic factors. Their Indonesian case study with PT. Amartha mikro 
fintek revealed improved credit risk prediction using a combined approach. The psychologi-
cal test was implemented efficiently, with completion possible within five minutes. Back-
ground factors from borrowers and company officers influenced testing time.

Djeundje et al. (2021) assessed predictive accuracy with alternative data for credit risk 
assessment.  Combining  email,  psychometric,  and  demographic  variables  outperformed 
using demographics alone. This enhanced accuracy supports using email and demographic 
data when credit history is absent. Similar outcomes were observed with psychometric data. 
Despite variable results from different sample splits, the approach remains promising. Their 
study also explored email usage as a predictor using diverse classifiers and identified alter-
natives for credit risk prediction when traditional data was scarce.

This innovative approach, driven by advancements in ML and big data analytics, offers 
promising avenues for enhancing credit risk assessment and fostering financial inclusion. 
The use of alternative data sources such as social media, mobile phone data, and psycho-
metric  assessments  reflects  the  evolution  of  credit  scoring  methodologies  in  response  to 
advances in financial technology.

These findings imply that alternative data is most valuable when traditional credit history 
is sparse or absent, offering lenders a pathway to expand financial inclusion. However, the 
benefits are not uniform across all contexts: improvements depend heavily on data qual-
ity, platform penetration, and the stability of behavioral signals over time. Moreover, reli-
ance  on  social  media  or  psychometric  variables  raises  concerns  about  privacy,  fairness, 
and  potential  proxy  discrimination,  making  careful  governance  and  regulatory  oversight 
essential. In practice, this means that while alternative data can enhance predictive accuracy, 
it should be integrated as a complement rather than a replacement for traditional financial 
indicators, with clear safeguards for consent, transparency, and ethical use.

7.4.2  Explainability and interpretability of machine learning models for credit scoring

Interpretability  and  explainability  are  critical  emerging  trends  and  advancements  in  the 
development of ML models for credit scoring. Although often used interchangeably, these 
terms have distinct meanings. Interpretability refers to the ability to understand model pre-
dictions without fully analyzing the internal mechanisms. Explainability, on the other hand, 
involves clarifying the internal workings of these models in human-understandable terms.
These concepts have gained attention due to the necessity for transparency in ML mod-
els. The need arises from the desire to understand how and why a particular borrower is 
granted or denied a loan (Bussmann et al. 2021). Additionally, the proprietary nature and 
increasing complexity of these models make it difficult for specialists to understand their 
inner workings.

---

<!-- PAGE 43 -->

Page 43 of 54  13

Consequently,  developing  tools  that  can  explain  these  models  in  a  reliable  and  inter-
pretable  manner  has  become  crucial.  LIME  and  SHAP  are  two  methods  used  to  explain 
predictions of black-box models. LIME uses  locally accurate explanations for individual 
predictions based on the assumption of local linearity. SHAP values explain predictions by 
quantifying the marginal contribution of each feature to the prediction.

Bussmann et al. (2021) proposed an interpretable AI model for credit risk management, 
especially  in  peer-to-peer  lending.  Using  correlation  networks  and  Shapley  values,  the 
model groups AI predictions by shared explanations. Analyzing 15,000 small businesses, 
the study found that similar financial characteristics could explain and predict credit scores 
for both risky and non-risky borrowers.

Bücker et al. (2022) proposed a framework for enhancing the interpretability of credit 
scoring models to align with transparency, auditability, and explainability goals for "black 
box" ML models. By using methods such as LIME and SHAP, they showed that interpret-
ability  comparable  to  traditional  scorecards  can  be  achieved  while  preserving  predictive 
capabilities.

Ayari and Guetari (2025) emphasized the importance of interpretability in credit scor-
ing models, showing that while EL improves predictive accuracy, understanding the role of 
individual features and base learners is crucial for transparency and trust. Using SHAP, their 
approach  quantified  the  contribution  of  each  feature  and  classifier,  supporting  regulatory 
compliance and ethical decision-making.

Bussmann  et  al.  (2021)  utilized  LIME  and  SHAP  to  explain  ML-based  credit  scoring 
models on the lending club dataset. Local and global insights were gained using these tech-
niques  and  SHAP  kernel  comparisons  were  explored. The  results  proved  that  LIME  and 
SHAP provided consistent explanations that are in line with financial logic.

By  embracing  these  trends,  the  credit  scoring  domain  is  making  an  impressive  move 
toward merging the power of ML with comprehensibility. Thus, the goal is to balance data 
availability with building trust among regulators by ensuring ML models are transparent 
and understandable.

The broader implication of these advances is that explainability has shifted from a techni-
cal option to a regulatory and operational requirement. By making complex models intel-
ligible to credit officers, auditors, and borrowers, tools such as SHAP and LIME not only 
foster trust but also help detect instability or bias in model predictions. This means that the 
successful deployment of ML in credit scoring now depends as much on interpretability and 
accountability as on predictive performance. Future developments will likely need to bal-
ance model complexity with explainability, ensuring that accuracy gains are not achieved at 
the expense of transparency or compliance.

7.5  RQ5: What are the challenges in adopting ML models for credit scoring?

The adoption of ML models in credit scoring presents numerous challenges, despite their 
potential  to  significantly  enhance  predictive  accuracy  and  efficiency. Among  these  chal-
lenges,  three  critical  issues  stand  out:  interpretability,  potential  biases,  and  the  curse  of 
dimensionality. These aspects are critical to ensuring models are not only effective but also 
equitable and transparent. In this subsection, we delve into these challenges.

<!-- PAGE 44 -->

7.5.1  Interpretability

Interpretability continues to pose a significant challenge in applying complex ML models 
to credit scoring. Although these models can offer high predictive accuracy, their decision-
making processes are often opaque, which makes it difficult for lenders to understand how 
credit decisions are made. This lack of transparency can be problematic for borrowers and 
regulators who require clear explanations for credit outcomes. Thus, achieving a balance 
between high interpretability and predictive performance is therefore a complex task.

Techniques such as LIME and SHAP have been developed to enhance the interpretability 
of black-box models. While these methods offer valuable insights into model predictions, 
they can sometimes provide inconsistent explanations for similar input data and may not 
fully uncover underlying model biases. Additionally, these techniques can be susceptible to 
adversarial attacks (Slack et al. 2020), raising concerns about their reliability in sensitive 
applications like credit scoring. Failure to address this challenge may result in difficulties 
aligning  model  outputs  with  regulatory  requirements  and  industry  standards,  potentially 
leading to a lack of trust in credit scoring systems.

Consequently, the need to develop and implement effective techniques for model inter-
pretability remains a pressing concern in the field of credit scoring. These techniques should 
not only make the decision-making process of ML models more understandable but also 
ensure that critical insights are clear in a way that aids in informed credit risk assessment.

7.5.2  Potential biases

Biases in training datasets can lead ML models to exhibit unfairness based on several cri-
teria. In credit scoring, for example, these criteria may include age, gender, race, caste, and 
religion, among others. Therefore, addressing bias is a major challenge in developing ML 
models, as they can perpetuate existing disparities if not carefully designed. In credit scor-
ing, failure to address bias can lead to serious consequences, including the reinforcement of 
social inequalities and ethical concerns (Ahmed 2022).

To mitigate biases, various techniques can be employed, including pre-processing, in-
processing, and post-processing methods (Jammalamadaka and Itapu 2023). Pre-processing 
techniques involve manipulating the training data to reduce bias before model training. In-
processing techniques can be integrated directly into the learning process to adjust model 
parameters during training to eliminate bias. Post-processing techniques refine model out-
puts  to  meet  fairness  criteria  after  initial  predictions  are  made. Although  mitigating  bias 
remains complex, these proactive measures can significantly enhance the fairness and reli-
ability of credit scoring systems.

7.5.3  The curse of dimensionality

The  curse  of  dimensionality  presents  significant  challenges  when  applying  ML  to  high-
dimensional  data. As  the  number  of  dimensions  increases,  computational  demands  rise, 
resulting in longer training times and greater memory consumption. Sparse data in high-
dimensional  spaces  can  lead  to  overfitting  as  models  struggle  to  generalize.  Models  are 
more likely to learn noise and irrelevant patterns, which adversely affect accuracy. Similarly, 
distance-based metrics become less meaningful, affecting algorithms such as clustering and

---

KNN. High-dimensional data increases model variability, complicating performance evalu-
ation and necessitating careful hyperparameter tuning (Jia et al. 2022).

Effective feature selection methods can help address these challenges. Techniques such 
as filter, wrapper, and embedded approaches are used to reduce the number of features while 
maintaining model generalization (Laborda and Ryoo 2021). Filter methods assess individ-
ual features based on statistical measures like correlation, information gain, or chi-square 
tests to identify those with greater predictive power. Wrapper methods evaluate different 
feature subsets using a chosen ML model, such as forward selection, backward elimination, 
or recursive feature elimination. While these methods provide a more exhaustive search by 
considering  the  interaction  between  features,  they  can  be  computationally  expensive  for 
large feature spaces. Embedded methods integrate feature selection into the  model train-
ing  process,  optimizing  feature  relevance  as  part  of  the  learning  algorithm.  By  applying 
appropriate feature selection techniques, the impact of the curse of dimensionality can be 
managed to enhance the robustness of ML models.

7.5.4  Behavioral and attitudinal data integration

In  addition  to  technical  and  data-related  challenges,  recent  research  has  highlighted  the 
importance of borrowers’ attitudes and behavioral factors in credit risk assessment. Accord-
ing to a qualitative study on educational loan repayment by postgraduate students in India 
(Bhandary  et  al.  2023),  loan  repayment  is  influenced  by  both  ability  and  willingness  to 
repay.  While  ability  is  commonly  measured  through  financial  indicators,  willingness  is 
reflected in attitudinal dimensions such as credit history, debt utility, financial knowledge, 
prioritizing repayment, and integrity. The study also identified gratification, debt burden, 
and lifestyle preferences as negative attitudes associated with delinquency. Integrating such 
subjective dimensions into ML models remains a significant challenge due to the difficulty 
in collecting and quantifying such data. However, doing so could improve the predictive 
power and fairness of credit scoring systems, especially in contexts like student or microfi-
nance loans where attitudinal variables play a more pronounced role.

7.5.5  Synthesis of challenges and practical implications

Overall,  these  challenges  illustrate  that  while  ML  models  can  enhance  predictive  perfor-
mance,  practical  adoption  in  credit  scoring  requires  careful  attention  to  interpretability, 
fairness, and feature management. Addressing interpretability is crucial for regulatory com-
pliance and maintaining borrower trust. Mitigating bias ensures equitable lending decisions 
and aligns with ethical standards. Managing high-dimensional data through feature selec-
tion not only improves computational efficiency but also reduces overfitting and enhances 
generalization. Integrating behavioral and attitudinal data, although complex, can signifi-
cantly improve model accuracy and inclusiveness, especially for non-traditional borrower 
segments such as students or microfinance clients. Together, these considerations highlight 
that successful ML deployment in credit scoring is as much about responsible model design 
and data handling as it is about predictive accuracy.

7.6  Comparison with existing literature reviews

This  SLR  differs  from  and  extends  prior  surveys  in  several  important  ways.  Existing 
reviews, such as Dastile et al. (2020), focused primarily on the performance of individual 
ML and ensemble classifiers from 2010 to 2018. Their review identified ensemble classi-
fiers like RFs and XGBoost as outperforming single models, and highlighted CNNs as the 
leading DL architecture. Our results confirm these observations, particularly the consistent 
high performance of ensemble and hybrid models across benchmark datasets. However, our 
review includes a broader range of ensemble and hybrid techniques, such as GA-NN and 
multi-stage ensemble models, which demonstrated even higher accuracy and AUC in recent 
studies.

This study (Kumar et al. 2021) presented a SLR focused on credit scoring within rural 
finance, emphasizing how fintech and AI technologies are transforming credit assessment 
in underserved areas. Their review highlighted the limitations of traditional banking in rural 
contexts and the benefits of integrating ML models such as ANN, SVM, RF, and hybrid 
approaches to improve financial inclusion. While their findings emphasized the socio-eco-
nomic impact and regulatory considerations, their performance analysis remained largely 
conceptual. In contrast, our review adopts a broader technical scope, systematically com-
paring  model  performance  across  standard  benchmark  datasets  and  incorporating  recent 
advancements such as model interpretability (SHAP,  LIME) and alternative data sources 
(social media, mobile phone usage, psychometrics). Therefore, our work complements by 
providing detailed empirical evidence and expanding the applicability of ML credit scoring 
models beyond rural-focused contexts

Hayashi  (2022)  emphasized  the  dominance  of  Deep  Belief  Networks  and  CNNs,  and 
discussed the challenges of interpretability and the potential of transforming structured data 
into image-like formats. In contrast, our findings reveal that while DL methods do show 
promise, they remain less commonly applied than ensemble or hybrid methods, largely due 
to their complexity and lower interpretability in practice.

Lenka et al. (2022) focused on ensemble models for imbalanced data and highlighted the 
use of SMOTE and GA for feature selection. Our results corroborate this trend by showing 
that models using SMOTE, GAs, and ensemble classifiers tend to achieve higher perfor-
mance, especially on imbalanced datasets such as Lending Club and German credit data. 
Additionally, we found that the integration of GA with NN or boosting further improves 
performance, which was not explored in their review.

Other surveys such as Markov et al. (2022) and Kamimura et al. (2023) provided histori-
cal and methodological overviews, highlighting the shift from traditional models (like LR, 
DTs) to hybrid and DL approaches. Our review confirms this evolution, but also emphasizes 
new developments such as the use of alternative data (social media, mobile usage, psycho-
metrics)  and  the  growing  importance  of  explainability techniques  like  SHAP  and  LIME, 
which were not widely discussed in previous SLRs.

Moreover, previous reviews often lacked detailed, ranked comparisons of model perfor-
mance across datasets. Our review contributes uniquely in this regard by compiling ranked 
tables of accuracy and AUC on four widely used datasets. This offers a clearer picture of the 
comparative effectiveness of different models and configurations.

In summary, while our findings align with prior work in recognizing the value of ensem-
ble  and  hybrid  models  for  credit  scoring,  we  extend  existing  literature  by  incorporating

---

more recent developments, evaluating a wider set of techniques and datasets, and offering 
practical comparisons across metrics and model types. We also address emerging themes 
like interpretability, alternative data, and algorithmic fairness, which are increasingly cen-
tral to responsible credit scoring.

A recent study by Bhandary and Ghosh (2025) offered a comprehensive empirical com-
parison of both traditional and modern ML techniques for credit scoring, using a well known 
real world dataset. Their work compared models such as LR, linear discriminant analysis, 
SVMs,  RF,  XGBoost,  and  deep  neural  networks,  and  showed  that  DL  models  achieved 
the highest predictive performance in terms of F1-score, G-mean, and AUC. Their results 
confirmed that, while statistical methods like LR still offered competitive accuracy, modern 
ML approaches (particularly deep neural networks) consistently outperformed traditional 
techniques across several performance metrics.

Notably, the study also addressed interpretability concerns in complex models by ana-
lyzing feature importance within the deep neural network. It found that behavioral factors 
such as age and payment history were key predictors, reinforcing earlier literature empha-
sizing  the  role  of  personal  characteristics  and  repayment  behavior  in  default  prediction. 
Although the study did not specifically address credit utilization, recent literature (Bhandary 
and Ghosh 2025) has emphasized its critical role in dynamic scoring, suggesting that high 
utilization by reliable borrowers may actually signal profitability for lenders. Furthermore, 
while  Bhandary  et  al.  discussed  LGD  in  the  context  of  aligning  scoring  with  risk  based 
capital planning, complementary work has stressed the importance of incorporating IFRS 9 
standards holistically, particularly PD, EAD, and LGD, to ensure compliance and financial 
soundness in advanced scoring models.

8  Limitations of this review

Firstly, this study included peer-reviewed journal papers and conference articles related to 
credit scoring. Our initial search filtration strategy yielded a large number of articles. Sev-
eral non-relevant studies were subsequently identified and excluded. This process ensured 
that the selected research papers met the inclusion criteria of the study. Nonetheless, includ-
ing more related papers would have enriched our conclusions.

Secondly, the search for articles was confined to only four online databases: IEEE Xplore, 
ACM Digital Library, Springer Link, and Google Scholar. Nonetheless, there may be other 
digital libraries with relevant studies that were overlooked. Moreover, identifying all rel-
evant research published within the five-year scope of our investigation proved challenging 
due to the increasing volume of studies in the field of credit scoring using ML techniques. 
Despite this limitation, our exhaustive exploration provides valuable insights into the cur-
rent landscape of credit scoring research employing ML methodologies.

Finally, this review lacks a comparative analysis to identify the most effective models 
for credit scoring. This challenge stems from the fact that the articles reviewed often used 
different evaluation metrics, even when relying on common datasets. As a result, any com-
parison would be subjective and potentially unreliable.

9  Conclusion

This SLR aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of ML applications in financial credit 
scoring from 2018 to 2024. By examining 63 carefully selected studies, the review identi-
fied the major ML methodologies employed, evaluated their strengths and limitations, and 
highlighted current trends and challenges in the domain.

The key findings indicate that ensemble and hybrid models, which often combine fea-
ture optimization and multiple classifiers, consistently outperform traditional single models 
in terms of accuracy and discrimination power across popular credit scoring datasets. DL 
techniques show promise with large datasets but face limitations related to interpretability 
and data availability. Moreover, the integration of alternative data sources such as social 
media, mobile usage, and psychometric data is an emerging trend that can enhance credit 
scoring, particularly for borrowers lacking formal credit histories. The growing emphasis 
on explainability methods such as LIME and SHAP demonstrates the field’s commitment to 
transparency and regulatory compliance.

The implications of these findings are significant for researchers, practitioners, and finan-
cial institutions. ML offers improved predictive capabilities and operational efficiencies, but 
challenges  around  model  interpretability,  bias  mitigation,  and  computational  complexity 
remain barriers to widespread adoption. Addressing these issues is critical for building trust-
worthy, fair, and scalable credit scoring systems that promote financial inclusion.

This review is limited by the heterogeneity of datasets, evaluation metrics, and method-
ologies in the literature, which complicates direct performance comparisons. Additionally, 
while this SLR highlights key trends and challenges, the fast-evolving nature of ML means 
continuous updates are necessary to capture new advances.

Future  research  should  focus  on  establishing  standardized  benchmarking  protocols  to 
enable fair and consistent evaluation of credit scoring models. Investigating robust integra-
tion  of  alternative  data  with  privacy  safeguards,  developing  more  interpretable  and  bias-
aware models, and exploring scalable solutions suitable for diverse institutional contexts 
are promising directions. Emphasis on real-world deployment challenges and ethical con-
siderations  will  also  be  essential  to  translate  research  advances  into  practical  credit  risk 
management tools.

Abstract
Over the past few decades, credit scoring has become an important tool in the financial
sector. It enables banks and financial institutions to assess the creditworthiness of indi-
viduals and reduce the risk of default. As a result of significant advances in artificial intel-
ligence techniques. Machine learning (ML) has made it possible to improve credit scoring
by distinguishing between people with good creditworthiness and those with poorer credit-
worthiness. In this article, we propose a systematic literature review of ML-based financial
credit scoring methods published between 2018 and 2024. A total of 330 research papers
were extracted from four different online databases and digital libraries. After the study
selection procedure, 63 research papers were selected for this systematic review. This
paper aims to identify the major ML methods used in credit scoring, assess their strengths
and limitations, and highlight notable trends and advancements. In addition, the review
addresses the critical challenges faced in the adoption of ML models for credit scoring.
This study not only contributes to the understanding of effective ML techniques used for
credit scoring but also guides future research by highlighting the promising avenues in
ML-based credit scoring efforts.

1 Introduction
In the contemporary highly dynamic and fast-paced financial landscape, banks and financial
institutions face the challenge of processing a large volume of loan applications quickly and
efficiently. Before the adoption of credit scoring, lending decisions were often influenced
by subjective judgments, personal biases, and intuitive assessments. In addition, manual
assessment of each borrower would be time-consuming and error-prone, leading to delays
and inconsistent decision-making (Kumar et al. 2021).
Credit scoring has since emerged as a cornerstone of modern lending practices. By offer-
ing a systematic, data-driven approach to evaluating borrower creditworthiness, it has trans-
formed the lending industry. At its core, credit scoring quantifies credit risk using applicants’
financial behavior and repayment history. It ensures objectivity, minimizes human bias, and
allows financial institutions to tailor loan terms based on risk profiles, thereby optimizing
risk-adjusted returns (Atiya 2001). The automation of credit risk evaluation not only accel-
erates loan approval processes enhancing operational efficiency and customer satisfaction,
but also strengthens financial stability for both lenders and borrowers.
Historically, standardized credit scoring models have been dominated by major credit
bureaus such as Equifax (Kenny 2018), Experian (Bradford 2007), and TransUnion (Macey
and Miller 1988). In the U.S., these agencies typically rely on the FICO score (Smith 2011),
which assesses five key factors: payment history, amounts owed, length of credit history,
new credit, and credit mix. These components are weighted to predict the borrower’s likeli-
hood of default.
Traditional models most commonly based on logistic regression or scorecards, are val-
ued for their interpretability, transparency, and regulatory acceptance (Malmi 2001). How-
ever, their limitations are significant: they depend on narrow feature sets, assume linear
relationships, and struggle to model complex behavioral patterns (Dastile et al. 2020). As a
result, they often underperform with non-traditional or heterogeneous credit profiles.
Complementing these scoring frameworks are regulatory standards such as the Inter-
national Financial Reporting Standard 9 (IFRS 9) (ElKelish 2021), which mandates the
estimation of Expected Credit Loss (ECL) through three parameters: Probability of Default
(PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and Loss Given Default (LGD). PD, derived from histori-
cal repayment data, is the most influential factor (Bhatore et al. 2020), while LGD reflects
the proportion of unrecovered assets and is calculated as one minus the recovery rate (Bhan-
dary and Ghosh 2025). EAD denotes the loan exposure subject to credit risk. IFRS 9 pro-
motes proactive credit risk recognition, enabling more accurate provisioning by integrating
historical data, present conditions, and reasonable forecasts.
Recent advances in ML have unlocked new capabilities for credit risk modeling. ML
models can capture nonlinearities, handle high-dimensional data, and adapt to evolving bor-
rower behavior (Lenka et al. 2022). They also allow the incorporation of alternative data
sources such as social media or mobile usage, enhancing prediction accuracy and enabling
more personalized assessments (Markov et al. 2022). Consequently, ML has garnered
increasing attention for its potential to improve the accuracy, fairness, and efficiency of
credit scoring systems (Hayashi 2022).
Nevertheless, several research challenges persist. Many studies lack standardized data-
sets, preprocessing methods, or evaluation metrics, hindering cross-study comparisons.
Complex models, such as Deep Learning (DL) and hybrid systems, often lack interpretabil-

ity, and although tools like LIME (Ribeiro et al. 2019) and SHAP (Lundberg and Lee 2017)
are emerging, their reliability and adoption remain limited. Integrating alternative data
sources into scalable systems raises ethical and privacy concerns. Issues of algorithmic bias
remain insufficiently addressed, posing serious risks of discriminatory lending. Moreover,
high-dimensional inputs can lead to overfitting or computational inefficiency, and feature
selection is frequently overlooked. The deployment of advanced models is also hampered
by their computational complexity, which may be prohibitive for smaller institutions.
This systematic literature review (SLR) presents a comprehensive synthesis of existing
research on ML applications in credit scoring. It evaluates how ML methods address the
limitations of traditional approaches and explores their capacity to deliver scalable, reliable,
and ethically sound credit decisions. We identify key ML techniques, assess their strengths
and weaknesses, and analyze emerging trends and innovations. This review also addresses
critical challenges in implementation, including interpretability, bias, and dimensionality,
and highlights areas for future research.
By consolidating findings from a broad range of studies, this SLR aims to inform
researchers, practitioners, and financial institutions alike. It clarifies gaps in the current lit-
erature, summarizes major opportunities and risks, and offers actionable recommendations.
Ultimately, this work contributes to the development of more transparent, fair, and robust
ML-based credit scoring systems, advancing financial inclusion and reinforcing trust in
automated financial decisions.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 lists some related works that over-
lap with the problem of credit scoring. Sect. 3 describes the methodology of the literature
review. Section 4 presents the ML methods used for credit scoring. Section 5 presents the
performance evaluation criteria. Section 6 presents the results. Section 7 presents the discus-
sion of this review. Section 8 addresses the limitations of this review, and Sect. 9 concludes

2 Related work
Several literature reviews have examined the use of ML techniques for borrower classifica-
tion in credit scoring. This section summarizes the most important reviews in this area.
Dastile et al. (2020) examined 74 studies (2010–2018) on statistical and ML models
for credit scoring. They found that ensemble methods such as Random Forests (RF) and
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) outperformed single classifiers and reaching 79%
accuracy. Among DL models, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieved the high-
est AUC of 90% on the German dataset and 99% on the Australian dataset. Key limitations
identified included the lack of macroeconomic variables and insufficient exploratory data
analysis, both critical for robust model development. The authors proposed a framework
addressing data preparation, feature extraction, and baseline models like Logistic Regres-
sion (LR) and Decision Trees (DT). They recommended future work on class imbalance
(like SMOTE Chawla et al. 2002), feature selection, and alternative classification thresholds.
In Kumar et al. (2021), the authors focused on credit scoring in rural finance, emphasizing
the role of Financial Technology (fintech) and ML/AI in improving access to underserved
populations. They highlighted ML models such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN),
SVMs, RF, LR, and hybrid models as effective tools for credit assessment. The study found
1 3

13 Page 4 of 54 H. Ayari et al.
that hybrid and AI-ML-based models yielded higher accuracy and efficiency by integrating
multiple techniques. Additionally, it stressed the importance of regulatory frameworks and
algorithmic transparency to ensure ethical implementation. These models were especially
impactful in rural contexts, enabling more inclusive credit access through the processing of
diverse data sources.
Hayashi (2022) conducted a systematic review (2019–2022) on DL in credit scoring,
highlighting the superior performance of Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) over models like
SVMs (Noble 2006), Gradient Boosting Trees (Ke et al. 2017), RFs (Breiman 2001), and LR
(Wright 1995). DBNs, using unsupervised learning, effectively extract deep features. The
study compared DL with ensemble and hybrid models on standard datasets and explored
novel approaches, such as converting tabular data into images for CNNs (Gu et al. 2018).
It addressed the interpretability challenge through rule extraction and stressed compliance
with GDPR (Tokarski 2020). The highest accuracy (98.66%) was achieved by Acharya et al.
(2022), with another model scoring 93.16% on the Japanese dataset (Zhang et al. 2021). The
review concluded that DL holds strong potential for integrating structured and unstructured
data with improved accuracy and explainability.
Lenka et al. (2022) presented an analysis of Ensemble Learning (EL) for imbalanced
credit scoring dataset. The research explored the impact of resampling techniques like
SMOTE and different feature selection methods such as information gain, principal com-
ponent analysis, and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) on improving the performance of credit
scoring models. The study conducted an extensive comparative analysis of 5 bases and 14
ensemble models using german, australian, and japanese datasets. The results highlighted
the effectiveness of the GA based feature selection technique and the CatBoost algorithm,
achieving the best accuracy with 86.70%, 88.40%, and 86.20%, respectively. The study
concluded by recommending the combination of CatBoost with GA-based feature selection
for building accurate and reliable credit scoring models.
In Markov et al. (2022), a review of credit scoring methodologies from 2016 to 2021 was
conducted, highlighting the evolution of credit risk assessment and its influence on lend-
ing, investment, and risk management decisions. Using a systematic approach, the authors
compared recent trends with those from 1991 to 2015, examining the shift from traditional
models such as LR and DTs to more advanced techniques like SVMs, ensemble meth-
ods, and neural networks. A key finding was the growing prominence of ensemble models,
recognized for their superior predictive performance. The review also noted the diversity
of complex models grouped under the "Other" category, which, despite performance vari-
ability, often produced strong results when appropriately applied. Furthermore, the study
highlighted the frequent use of public datasets such as the Australian and German credit
datasets, which enhance model development, address class imbalance issues, and support
reproducibility and generalization. This reflects a broader trend in credit scoring research.
Kamimura et al. (2023) conducted a review of 46 studies on optimization methods for
Credit Scoring Models (CSMs) published between 2008 and 2022. The review identified a
wide use of techniques including financial analysis, ML, and data mining. Logistic Regres-
sion (13%), Naive Bayes (10%), and Neural Networks (7%) were the most commonly used
methods, with a growing trend toward hybrid models (72%). The study emphasized the need
to integrate big data and DL for future CSM development and highlighted the importance
of addressing legal, ethical, and practical issues. It also called for more research focused on
small businesses and the use of diverse data sources.

4 Machine learning methods for the credit scoring process
ML, a subfield of AI, focuses on designing algorithms that enable systems to learn from
data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. These algo-
rithms identify patterns in data and adapt their performance over time. ML can be broadly
categorized into supervised learning (Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil 2006) and unsupervised
learning (Dike et al. 2018).
In supervised learning, models are trained using labeled data, where each input (X) is
associated with a corresponding output (Y). The model learns to map inputs to outputs,
enabling it to classify or predict outcomes for new, unseen data. In contrast, unsupervised
learning uses unlabeled data, where the model identifies patterns, similarities, or clusters
without predefined output labels.
Various ML algorithms, such as conventional ML, DL, EL, and hybrid models, have
gained significant attention due to their enhanced predictive capabilities in credit scoring
tasks. The following sections explore the application and performance of these techniques
in the context of credit scoring.
4.1 Traditional machine learning models
This section describes the conventional ML models used for credit scoring.
4.1.1 Logistic regression
LR is a well-established algorithm commonly used in credit scoring (Dastile et al. 2020).
It is a probabilistic classification model that estimates the probability of a binary outcome
(Atiya 2001). It is particularly valuable in credit scoring as it estimates the conditional
probability of an input belonging to a particular class (default or non-default) (Ala’raj et al.
2022). Given a feature vector x Rd, the model computes (formula 1):
∈
1
P(Y =1x)= (1)
| 1+e
−
(β0+βTx)
1 3

Machine learning powered financial credit scoring: a systematic… Page 9 of 54 13
where Y 0,1 is the binary response variable (1 = default, 0 = non-default), β is the
∈{ } 0
intercept term, and β = (β 1 ,β 2 ,...,β d )T is the coefficient vector. The parameters β 0 ,β
are estimated by maximizing the log-likelihood function:
N
ℓ(β 0 ,β)= [y i logp(xi )+(1 − y i )log(1 − p(xi ))] (2)
i=1
∑
where p(xi )=P(Y =1xi ). This optimization is typically performed using iterative meth-
|
ods like Newton–Raphson or gradient descent (Hosmer and Lemeshow 2000).
Its simplicity, good performance with smaller datasets, and robustness against noise
make it a favored choice for credit scoring. However, the assumption of a linear relationship
between inputs and log odds may not always hold, especially in cases where the relationship
is nonlinear.
Cao et al. (2021) introduced a ML credit score and default probability model with LR
showing the best performance in 5-fold validation. They utilized attribute weighting for
feature selection based on information ranking and recommended focusing on recall for
imbalanced data. By setting an optimal probability threshold of 0.18 using Youden’s index,
they improved TPR while reducing FNR achieving 86.58% accuracy.
Dumitrescu et al. (2022) introduced Penalized Logistic Tree Regression (PLTR), a power-
ful and interpretable credit scoring system. They enhanced LR using rules from short-depth
DTs as predictors and enabled non-linear effects capture while retaining interpretability. The
proposed method achieved the best AUC with 92.99%, 77.80%, and 90.11% in autralian,
taiwan, and housing datasets respectively. The proposed PLTR improved credit risk predic-
tion of monte carlo simulations and real-world applications.
Ariza-Garzón et al. (2020) compared the LR model and other algorithms such as RF,
DT, and XGBoost for peer-to-peer lending scoring. XGBoost excelled in the default class
though it ranked third in the non-default class with the highest precision. The study revealed
that LR achieved the best accuracy (78.10%) and AUC (66.60%) on the lending club dataset
compared to the other ML models. Their research demonstrated the possibility of build-
ing accurate and transparent ML models. These models can win the trust of industry play-
ers, regulators, and end-users, especially in contexts where explainability is crucial in P2P
lending.
4.1.2 Decision trees
DTs (Safavian and Landgrebe 1991) are supervised models used for both regression and
classification tasks. The structure of the model mirrors that of a tree, with a root, branches,
and leaves representing decisions made based on attribute values. DTs split data by select-
ing attributes that maximize information gain, forming a decision path until no further splits
are possible (Aniceto et al. 2020). A key advantage of DTs is their interpretability, as they
provide clear, understandable decision rules. They are also capable of capturing nonlinear
relationships between features and the target variable, making them suitable for complex
datasets. However, DTs can be highly sensitive to the training data, which leads to overfit-
ting or instability when the dataset changes slightly (Ariza-Garzón et al. 2020).

Syed Nor et al. (2019) developed a personal bankruptcy prediction model using the DT
technique. The study defined bankruptcy as terminated members who failed to settle their
loans, using a sample of 24,546 cases with 17% settled and 83% terminated. The data-
set included a dependent variable (bankruptcy status) and 12 predictors collected from an
authorized debt management agency. The findings provided profiles of bankrupts, a reliable
personal bankruptcy scoring model achieving 83.29% accuracy, 06.62% specificity, and
99.00% sensitivity, and identified significant variables on imbalanced data.
Khedr et al. (2021) developed a new predictive method for default customers’ loans using
ML. The method utilized available personal data and historical credit data to evaluate the
creditworthiness of customers for loans. The ABE dataset was used for training and testing,
incorporating 10 features from the application form and i-score report class to assist credit
officers in making informed decisions and avoiding random customer selection. The per-
formance of several classifiers was compared before and after feature selection. The results
indicated that the DT classifier outperformed other classifiers with a significant prediction
accuracy of almost 94.85% accuracy and 96.75% F1-score.
Maharjan (2022) applied three different classifiers, C4.5, CART, and Naïve Bayes, to
predict loan grants and attribute selection. Their research aimed to help financial institutions
seek better strategies through credit scoring models. They concluded that categories 4 and
8 were the best, while categories 3, 6, and 11 were the worst, as these had higher false posi-
tive values in all C4.5, CART, and Naïve Bayes testing. Among the classifiers, C4.5 was
the best for predicting loans, achieving an 85.23% F1-score and 78.33% accuracy on the
german loan dataset.
4.1.3 Random forest
RF is a supervised learning model that aggregates multiple DTs to make predictions for
classification and regression tasks. The core technique behind RF is bagging, or bootstrap
aggregation, which involves resampling the training dataset with replacement to create mul-
tiple subsets. A DT is trained on each of these subsets and predictions are made based on a
majority vote across all trees (Dastile et al. 2020). RF is known for its speed and simplicity,
effectively handling high-dimensional data, and being less prone to overfitting compared to
individual DTs (Teles et al. 2021). However, the reliance of the model on numerous trees
can complicate the interpretability of its results.
Trivedi (2020) developed a credit scoring prediction model through the integration of
various feature selection methods such as information gain, gain ratio, and chi-square and
ML classifiers such as naïve bayes, RF, DT (C5.0), and SVM. Their proposed model proved
the effectiveness of a combination of RF and chi-Square in achieving strong performance
with 93.12% accuracy and 93.10% F1-score on german dataset. However, it required a
slightly longer training time than other approaches.
Li et al. (2021) introduced a deep forest or multi-grained Cascade Forest (gcForest)
model based on a RF algorithm. The gcForest efficiently processes high-dimensional fea-
ture information using multidimensional scanning and cascading. They created a two-stage
hybrid default discrimination model by combining gcForest with multiple feature selection
methods. The proposed model achieved the best accuracy (81.20%) and AUC (86.80%) on
a german dataset.

Moscato (2021) conducted a benchmarking analysis of prevalent credit risk scoring
models for predicting loan repayment in P2P platforms. Addressing class imbalance, they
evaluated classifiers with various sampling strategies and selected RF, LR, and Multi-Layer-
Perceptron (MLP) combined with Random Under Sampling (RUS) and IHT. Among these,
the RF-RUS combination demonstrated the most effective performance achieving 64.00%
accuracy, 63.00% recall, and 71.70% AUC on the lending club dataset.
Aji and Dhini (2019) applied data mining to address non-performing loan issues focused
on mortgage loans. Using a dataset from an Indonesian bank that provided mortgage loans,
they used RF with AdaBoost classifiers. Their analysis indicated that the model achieved the
best results with 72.95% accuracy, 73.00% recall, and 70.40% specificity.
Tran et al. (2021) developed a credit scoring method in vietnam. They employed
machine-learning models such as LightGBM, CatBoost, and RF derived from their partici-
pation in the kalapa credit score challenge. Their evaluation ultimately determined RF as the
best-performing model based on their experimental outcomes achieving 83.00% F1-score
and 81.00% AUC on Kalapa dataset. In addition, this was the first model applied in the field
of vietnamese banking.
Parvin and Saleena (2020) attempted to forecast credit scores using several classifier
models (LR, RF, DT, SVM, K nearest neighbor, naive bayes, extra trees classifier, ada
boosting, bagged DT, and MLP) and evaluated the effectiveness of each model using met-
rics. A comparison study was conducted to determine the best classifier for predicting credit
scores. The experimental results showed that the RF model provided greater accuracy with
88.41%, recall with 80.00%, precision with 87.00%, and F1-score with 84.00% on the aus-
tralian dataset.
Zhang et al. (2018) introduced a credit scoring model (NCSM) based on feature selection
and grid search to optimize the RF algorithm. To improve prediction accuracy, the model
lowered the influence of irrelevant and redundant information. Information entropy was
regarded as the heuristic that was used to select the best feature in NCSM. The experimental
results demonstrated that NCSM achieved 91.71% accuracy on the australian dataset and
82.14% accuracy on the german dataset.
4.1.4 Support vector machine
SVM is a supervised learning model that maps data into a high-dimensional space and
separates it into two classes using a linear separator known as a hyperplane (Teles et al.
2021). Commonly used for classification tasks, SVM identifies the optimal hyperplane by
maximizing the margin between classes while minimizing the distance of the closest points
(known as support vectors) from the boundary (Cervantes et al. 2020). Various kernels, such
as linear, polynomial, radial basis function, and sigmoid can be applied to handle different
data structures (Friedman et al. 1997). With the appropriate kernel, SVM is effective for
both linearly and non-linearly separable datasets. However, kernel selection significantly
affects performance and may increase training time on large datasets (Huang et al. 2007).
Teles et al. (2021) applied credit scoring using collateral as an independent variable and
compared SVM and RF models in forecasting the recovered credit value. The SVM model
achieved a slightly higher classification accuracy (98.34%) compared to RF (98.20%) on a
bank institution dataset.
1 3

Dm and Mm (2018) compared loan default prediction in Kenya using SVM and LR
models. The data was used from equity bank and split into training and test sets. The LR
model showed an accuracy of 77.27% with the train data and 73.33% with the test data, and
a precision of 84.40% and 82.44%, respectively. The SVM with a linear kernel model had
an accuracy of 88.29% and 86.12% with the train and test data, respectively, and a precision
of 87.85% and 78.31%. The SVM model outperformed the LR model, which led the study
to recommend the use of SVM for loan default prediction in financial institutions.
Wang and Li (2019) improved credit assessment predictions using an SVM-based model.
Recognizing that SVM performance heavily relies on parameter selection, they employed
an Improved Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (IFOA) to optimize these parameters. The
study analyzed P2P loan data using Linear Regression, Classical SVM, FOA-SVM, and
IFOA-SVM, finding that the IFOA-SVM model provided the most accurate predictions by
achieving the best precision (93%).
4.1.5 K nearest neighbors
The K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (Guo et al. 2003) model is a non-parametric supervised
learning technique that functions by utilizing two parameters, the distance function and
the selected k value, with performance based on the aforementioned factors. KNN initially
calculates the distance between all data points and accumulates those that are near to it for
any new data point. The algorithm uses a chosen distance function (such as Euclidean or
Manhattan) to identify and group the nearest neighbors to the target data point. Next, it col-
lects a specified number of data points that have the shortest distance between them all and
classify them based on their distance. However, because KNN calculates a distance metric
for every data point during classification, it incurs higher computational demands which can
be perceived as a drawback in terms of computational cost (Zhang et al. 2017).
Mukid et al. (2018) reviewed the Weighted K-Nearest Neighbor (WKNN) method for
credit assessment, considering the use of various kernel functions. The research utilized
credit data from a private bank in indonesia. The results demonstrated that the gaussian ker-
nel and rectangular kernel significantly improved the performance of the WKNN method.
Specifically, the gaussian and rectangular kernels achieved an accuracy of 82.40% and a
very high sensitivity of 99.34%, though the specificity was relatively low (11.11%), which
indicated that the model strongly favored identifying positive cases.
Loo et al. (2023) predicted the risk of loan default using various ML algorithms (LR,
DT, RF, KNN, SVM, and naïve bayes) and compared these algorithms to identify the most
suitable one for predicting loan default risk. In addition, they assisted the decision-makers
in approving or rejecting loan requests in india. Using a dataset from kaggle focused on
loan applicants in India, they analyzed behavior to determine risk. KNN emerged as the best
model, scoring the highest in all evaluation metrics (accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score)
with a score of 89%.
Pratiwi et al. (2019) applied the pseudo nearest neighbor (PNN) method to identify pro-
spective borrowers eligible for loan proposals. The study used historical credit data from
a national bank in indonesia to focus on characteristics such as age, number of children,
business duration, income, loan amount, and credit period. If a new borrower had charac-
teristics similar to a good historical borrower, the loan proposal was approved; otherwise,
it was refused. The k-NN method achieved the best classification with k = 1, resulting in
1 3

the smallest error of 1.89%. The best classification for PNN was with k = 13, yielding the
smallest error of 20.75%. Overall, k-NN proved to be more accurate for credit classification
than PNN.
4.1.6 Hybrid and composite machine learning models
Hybrid and composite ML models integrate multiple algorithms to enhance predictive per-
formance in credit scoring. By combining supervised and unsupervised techniques, they
overcome individual limitations and improve accuracy and robustness.
Unsupervised learning models are valuable in credit scoring for uncovering hidden pat-
terns in data. When used in hybrid models for feature selection (Tripathi et al. 2018) and
segmentation (Boughaci et al. 2021), they improve prediction accuracy and provide essen-
tial inputs for supervised models, enhancing overall performance and discriminative power.
Various studies have been proposed to prove the effectiveness of hybrid ML models in the
credit scoring domain.
Goh et al. (2020) proposed a hybrid model that integrated Harmony Search (HS) for both
feature selection and hyperparameter tuning. They introduced a Modified HS (MHS), incor-
porating elitism and exploration-exploitation strategies to improve efficiency. The combi-
nation of MHS and RF (MHS-RF) achieved 87.38% accuracy on the australian dataset,
offering improved explainability and computational efficiency (full results in Table 6).
Nalic et al. (2020) suggested a novel hybrid data mining model that combined fea-
ture selection and EL methods. They utilized various preprocessing techniques and five
alternative feature selection algorithms integrating their results through innovative voting
methods. The hybrid model using the IfAny voting method and the GLM + DT ensemble
outperformed other classifiers by reaching 87.69% accuracy and 87.69% F1-score on a bos-
nia dataset.
Yao and Chen (2019) proposed a new hybrid RF-SVM ensemble model that used RF to
select essential variables and ensemble methods to aggregate SVM as a robust classifier.
The testing results indicated that the proposed model achieved the best accuracy on the
australian dataset with 87.94%, 83.85% recall, and 92.10% AUC. This model demonstrated
promising effectiveness and potential for application in credit scoring.
Zhang et al. (2021) devised a credit-scoring hybrid ensemble model that combined
voting-based outlier detection and balanced sampling. Their approach aimed to enhance
prediction accuracy by reducing noise impact during classifier training. They introduced
a weighted voting mechanism for outlier detection and employed bagging-based balanced
sampling to address class imbalance. The effectiveness of the model was proved through
experiments by achieving 99.77% and 99.71% F1-score on the creator dataset.
Tripathi et al. (2019) developed a hybrid model that improved credit scoring prediction
through feature selection and a multilayer ensemble classifier framework. Their approach
involved three phases: ranking and weighting classifiers, ensemble feature selection, and
using selected features in a multilayer ensemble classifier architecture. Additionally, they
introduced a Choquet integral-based classifier placement algorithm, achieving 92.69%
accuracy, 97.16% recall, and 88.46% specificity on the australian dataset.
Using unsupervised learning, Yuan et al. (2022) introduced a two-stage default predic-
tion model that combined k-means clustering for sample partitioning and support vector
domain description (SVDD) for credit scoring. The model utilized data from multi-temporal
1 3

13 Page 14 of 54 H. Ayari et al.
data and demonstrated a five-year default prediction capability (AUC >0.85). The results
(Table 6) showed that the proposed model achieved the best results on the real-world dataset
achieving 86.33% AUC and 86.12% G-mean.
Boughaci et al. (2021) developed a hybrid method using clustering and RF techniques
for credit scoring and financial bankruptcy prediction. They employed k-means clustering
to group applicants and then applied RF to the clustered data. The results showed that the
proposed model achieved the best results on taiwan dataset with 100% recall, 100% preci-
sion, and 100% F1-score. The approach improved classification performance and showed
promise in applicant segmentation.
Suleiman et al. (2021) proposed a method for improving the discriminant capabilities of
KNN and neural networks using unsupervised learning based on a SOM. The knowledge
obtained by SOM was used as input to the subsequent pattern recognition models in the
two-stage method. The results showed that the two-stage models improved the performance
of both neural networks and KNN performances achieving 96.30% accuracy with SOM
with KNN while SOM with neural networks achieved 97.30% accuracy on the bank of
agriculture dataset.
Bao et al. (2019) proposed a unique strategy that combines unsupervised and supervised
learning for credit risk assessment. They applied unsupervised techniques in consensus
models like SOM at two stages: consensus formation and dataset clustering using k-means
to group samples by presence conditions. Their approach outperformed other methods
achieving 92.00% accuracy on the chinese P2P credit dataset.
Ibrahim and Olagunju (2022) introduced a two-stage credit scoring model employing
SOM and CART. This approach fed the knowledge from clusters of SOM into CART for
classification. Results from BOA’s Sokoto data showed enhancement and boosted the per-
formance of CART from 96.30% to 96.70%. This integration of SOM with CART outper-
formed the standalone CART model.
4.2 Deep learning models
DL (Hayashi 2022) is a subset of ML that is based on ANN with multiple layers between
the input and output layers. These deep neural networks are powerful tools since they are
capable of extracting intricate patterns and features from complex datasets automatically.
This section describes DL models used for credit scoring.
4.2.1 Artificial neural network
ANN are computational DL models inspired by biological neurons. They consist of inter-
connected artificial neurons that can perform complex computations and adapt their struc-
tures based on external signals or information. A common architecture is a MLP consisting
of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The training focuses on
minimizing the loss function and refining predictions through weight and bias adjustments
via backpropagation (Rumelhart et al. 1986). Despite their ability to automatically extract
features and perform well on larger datasets, ANNs are considered a “Black Box” posing
challenges in interpretation which is a crucial factor in credit scoring where transparency is
vital (Ariza-Garzón et al. 2020).

Kazemi et al. (2023) proposed a method using a GA and neural networks to find optimal
cut-off values based on performance metrics and the dataset. Their approach outperformed
the standard threshold of 0.5 by achieving the highest accuracy with 91.91% and AUC with
92.60% on the australian dataset which resulted in more accurate classifications.
Kazemi et al. (2021) introduced a hybrid method using a GA to optimize the structural
parameters of a neural network classifier for enhanced accuracy. They applied this approach
to the australian and german credit scoring datasets and achieved significant improvements:
2.68% and 0.1% enhancements, respectively. The statistical analysis supported the effec-
tiveness of their algorithm in parameter tuning.
Diaconescu and Neagoe (2020) introduced a credit-scoring DL technique that defined
credit score as the weighted sum of false negative errors and false positive mistakes. This
model aimed for the lowest possible score emphasizing FN (low credit projected as good)
to minimize the missed alarm rate across the total number of faults. Optimization methods
were employed to select a deep-learning neural network architecture and hyperparameters
for their approach and the model achieved 84.83% accuracy on the german dataset.
4.2.2 Convolutional neural networks
CNNs are deep feedforward neural networks that have been widely used for their great
capacity to extract local image information. Unlike traditional supervised learning meth-
ods, CNNs eliminate the need for manual feature extraction. They handle feature extraction
and description during the learning phase and aim to minimize classification errors. The
architecture comprises convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers, each with specific
processes for visual property extraction and classification (Rumelhart et al. 1986). The con-
volution layer uses filters for feature detection, pooling reduces image size while preserving
key characteristics and the fully connected layer performs classification on flattened fea-
tures. While CNNs are standard for images, their direct application to structured credit data
requires careful adaptation.
Dastile and Celik (2021) proposed an interpretable DL model for credit scoring to meet
legal decision-making criteria. They transformed tabular data into images employing 2D
CNNs. In their approach, each image pixel represented a feature from the tabular dataset.
Their model was tested on three public credit scoring datasets achieving the best results on
the australian dataset with 95.00% accuracy.
Zhu et al. (2018) proposed a model that combines CNN and the feature selection algo-
rithm relief. Experiments were carried out on a real-world dataset from a Chinese consumer
finance company. The findings demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing
benchmarks like LR and RF achieving 91.64% accuracy, 96.89% AUC, and 91.64% KS.
Neagoe et al. (2018) presented a new approach to applying and evaluating Deep CNN
versus MLP for financial prediction. They designed a credit scoring model using two neural
network classifiers. A MLP with eight layers and a DCNN with thirteen layers. Experi-
ments using the german and australian credit datasets evaluated model performance based
on overall accuracy, false alarm rate, and missed alarm rate. The results demonstrated the
effectiveness of the proposed approach, as the DCNN significantly outperformed the MLP
in both datasets. For the german credit dataset, DCNN achieved an OA of 90.85%, com-
pared to MLP’s 81.20%. For the australian credit dataset, DCNN reached an OA of 99.74%,
while MLP obtained 90.75%.

4.2.3 Long short-term memory network
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997) is a type
of recurrent neural network designed to handle variable length sequences. Comprising
LSTM units with input, output, and forget gates, these networks can remember values over
extended periods. LSTM is employed to construct layers within neural networks (Yotsawat
et al. 2021). The forget gate determines which parts of cell states are worth remembering
based on the cell state passed on from the previous time step. While the input gate manages
information flow to preserve pertinent data from irrelevant updates (Hochreiter 1998). The
cell state gate calculates the new data to be stored in the memory cell and the output gate
guides the actual prediction based on the current memory cell. LSTM networks excel at
capturing extended dependencies in sequential data. This makes them well-suited for credit
risk assessment where historical features are essential (Ala’raj et al. 2022) and they auto-
matically extract relevant features without extensive manual engineering. However, they
often require a large amount of data to achieve good performance which can be challenging
due to the privacy of the credit data.
Ala’raj et al. (2021) aimed to aid bank management in assessing credit card clients by
predicting missed payments. Their model used bidirectional LSTM to calculate the likeli-
hood of missed payments for each customer in the following month. The scores of the
model correlated with payment probabilities to enhance consumer credit scoring according
to experimental results with 82.40% accuracy, 95.15% specificity, and 78.47% AUC on the
non-transactional.
Wang et al. (2018) utilized borrowers’ online behavior data to create a consumer credit
scoring method employing Attention Mechanism LSTM (AM-LSTM). They treated events
as words, transformed them into vectors using the Event2vec model, and employed an atten-
tion mechanism LSTM network to predict user default likelihood. The results showed the
effectiveness of the proposed model in achieving 71.00% AUC and 31.00% KS on the P2P
lending platform dataset.
Ala’raj et al. (2022) employed DL to help bank management in credit card client scoring.
They predicted consumer behavior across three dimensions: missed payments, purchasing
behavior, and customer grouping based on mathematical expectations of loss. Two models
named missed payment prediction LSTM and purchase estimation prediction LSTM were
devised to enhance decision-making through customer behavioral grouping. The experi-
ment was tested on the transactional dataset giving the best results with 90.69% accuracy,
72.87% recall, 82.94% KS, and 91.00% AUC.
Adisa et al. (2022) applied LSTM for the financial domain which was rarely used for
credit scoring prediction. Their research presented an optimization approach (GA) to deter-
mine the optimal parameters for the LSTM model, including epochs, batch size, number of
neurons, learning rate, and dropout. The results showed that the optimized LSTM model
outperformed both single classifiers and ensemble models with 89.27% accuracy on the
australian dataset.

4.2.4 Hybrid deep learning models
Hybrid DL models combine multiple DL techniques or integrate traditional ML methods
with DL approaches. Various studies have been proposed to prove the effectiveness of these
models.
In a follow-up study, Pławiak et al. (2020) introduced the Deep Genetic Hierarchical
Network of Learners (DGHNL) that combined evolutionary computation, EL, and DL. This
approach applied to the statlog australian data featured a 16-layer genetic cascade ensemble
of classifiers including SVMs, normalization methods, feature extraction, kernel functions,
and parameter optimizations. Their proposed model holds potential for use in the banking
system achieving 97.39% accuracy on the australian dataset.
Pławiak et al. (2020) introduced the Deep Genetic Hierarchical Network of Learners
(DGHNL) that combined various learners, normalization procedures, feature extraction
methods, kernel functions, and parameter optimizations. Their approach incorporated DL,
EL, genetic feature selection, and optimization, focusing on proper information flow and
fusion within the DGHNL structure. The results showed the potential of the proposed model
achieving 94.60% accuracy on the german dataset.
Shen et al. (2021) devised a novel DL ensemble model for credit risk assessment by
addressing imbalanced credit data. They combined the LSTM network with the AdaBoost
algorithm followed by an enhanced SMOTE method for data training. Experimental results
indicated the superiority of their proposed model compared to other methods with 80.32%
AUC and 39.48% KS on the german credit dataset.
4.3 Ensemble learning models
EL (Dong et al. 2020) is a powerful ML technique that warrants separate examination. This
approach involves the integration of multiple learning algorithms to enhance predictive per-
formance by combining the strengths of diverse models. This section describes EL models
used for credit scoring.
4.3.1 Gradient boosting decision trees
Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) is an ensemble ML method that is widely
employed in both classification and regression tasks. The gradient boosting concept involves
combining weak base learners often DTs with high bias and low variance to craft a robust
and accurate model. GBDT extends the boosting approach by employing a boosting-based
error minimization strategy to generate models additively (Liu et al. 2021). The model con-
tinues to add trees until a predefined number of trees are built, the loss reaches an accept-
able level, or a specified stopping criterion is met. GBDT models can be computationally
expensive when dealing with deep trees or complex problems, often consuming a significant
amount of memory (Friedman 2001).
Liu et al. (2021) proposed a multi-grained and multi-layered gradient-boosting deci-
sion tree (GBDT) for credit scoring. This approach combined the representation learning
capability of neural networks with the robustness of ensemble-based methods. Then, they
explored the hierarchical representation learning ability of the proposed method. Finally,
they enhanced the representation ability of the multi-layered framework by incorporating a
1 3

13 Page 18 of 54 H. Ayari et al.
multigrained scanning mechanism. The model achieved favorable results (88.26% accuracy
and 94.07% AUC on the australian dataset) by minimizing intra-class distance and increas-
ing inter-class distance.
Zou and Gao (2022) developed a supervised NN-based augmented GBDT-AugBoost-
ELM for enhanced credit scoring. This approach utilized bagging ensemble training and
boosting ensemble optimization to diversify base learners. The proposed method was tested
on several public datasets (table 6) and achieved the best results on the japanese dataset with
86.87% accuracy and 87.91% F1-score.
Bai et al. (2022) proposed a non-parametric ensemble tree model called Gradient Boost-
ing Survival Tree (GBST) to handle heterogeneous industrial data from the chinese con-
sumer financing sector. GBST extended traditional survival tree models by incorporating
gradient boosting to optimize survival probabilities over time. This approach effectively
minimized total error and proved its superiority in estimating credit risk by achieving
82,51% AUC and 51,64% KS on the 360 finance dataset.
Zhang et al. (2020) introduced a P2P lending online integrated credit scoring model
(OICSM) that combined a GBDT with a neural network. OICSM improved credit scoring
by handling two types of features and enabling online updates. Tests using real credit data-
sets from the US and china validated the effectiveness of OICSM achieving the best results
by 73.39% AUC on the lending club dataset and 71.76% AUC on the paipaidai dataset. Its
advantage in DL and online dynamic update capability contributed to its significant perfor-
mance improvement.
4.3.2 The extreme gradient boosting
XGBoost model is an ensemble model that combines tree models with gradient boosting. A
tree model is a type of supervised model that partitions explanatory variables to best clas-
sify the response variable and generates decision trees in parallel (Nobre and Neves 2019).
Boosting is a reinforcement algorithm that progressively adds model iterations by adjust-
ing the weights of the weak learners (trees) to minimize error iteration after iteration. Each
subsequent tree attempts to reduce the errors introduced by the previous tree. This reduces
model bias and improves overall accuracy (Ampountolas et al. 2021). XGBoost not only
improves tree models by improving classification performance, but it is also faster than
tree model algorithms. In addition, XGBoost is an advanced gradient-boosting model that
mitigates overfitting by carefully balancing the reduction of the objective function and the
complexity of the model (Ariza-Garzón et al. 2020).
Ampountolas et al. (2021) evaluated ML algorithms on microlending data to classify
borrowers into credit categories. They highlighted the success of using customer data and
off-the-shelf classifiers like the XGBoost algorithm. The model achieved 88.00% recall,
71.00% specificity, and 78.00% F1-score on the micro-loans dataset. This approach offers
a dependable and cost-effective way for developing-world micro-lending institutions to
assess creditworthiness without relying on credit history or centralized databases.
Xia et al. (2021) proposed a novel dynamic credit scoring model, SurvXGBoost, which
combines survival analysis with the GBDT approach. This model aimed to improve predict-
ability for personal default over time and addresses censoring issues. Compared to bench-
mark models on a real-world consumer loan dataset, SurvXGBoost achieved an AUC of
68.08%. The results of out-of-sample (68.07% AUC) and out-of-time validation (67.07%
1 3

Machine learning powered financial credit scoring: a systematic… Page 19 of 54 13
AUC) indicated that SurvXGBoost outperformed the benchmarks in terms of predictability
and misclassification cost (64.84%). SurvXGBoost maintained interpretability by providing
information on feature importance.
Yotsawat et al. (2021) proposed an improved credit scoring model based on XGBoost
classifier using bayesian hyper-parameters optimization (XGBoost-BO). The model
involved two steps: data pre-processing to handle missing values and scale the data, fol-
lowed by bayesian hyper-parameter optimization to tune the XGBoost classifier. The model
was evaluated on four public datasets (german, australian, lending club, and polish). Sev-
eral state-of-the-art classification algorithms were used for predictive comparison. The
results showed that the proposed model improved accuracy by 4.10%, 3.03%, and 2.76%
on the german, lending club, and australian datasets, respectively. The experimental results
confirmed that the XGBoost-BO model was suitable for assessing the creditworthiness of
applicants.
4.3.3 Hybrid ensemble learning models
Similar to hybrid machine and DL models, hybrid EL models represent an innovative
approach that combines the strengths of different ensemble techniques or integrating them
with other ML methods. The development of these models has shown promising results,
particularly in enhancing predictive accuracy and robustness in complex datasets.
He et al. (2018) developed a novel ensemble model for credit scoring that addressed
the imbalance ratio dataset. Their algorithm modified BalanceCascade for balanced subsets
and utilized RF and XGBoost classifiers in a three-stage ensemble. Stacking generated new
features from the first layer’s outcomes for the second layer optimized via particle swarm
optimization. The suggested model demonstrated its superiority in the japanease dataset
achieving 88.04% F1-score, 92.79% AUC, 86.22% G-mean, and 75.80% KS.
Rofik et al. (2024) proposed a credit risk assessment model that integrates SMOTE for
class imbalance treatment and stacking EL to enhance prediction performance. The base
learners in their stacking framework include RF, SVM, Extra Trees Classifier, with XGBoost
serving as the meta-learner. The study followed a structured pipeline involving data collec-
tion, preprocessing, oversampling, modeling, and evaluation, and used the German Credit
dataset with cross-validation. Results demonstrated strong performance with an accuracy of
83.21%, precision of 79.29%, recall of 91.78%, and an F1-score of 85.08%, highlighting
the effectiveness of combining SMOTE with stacking techniques for credit scoring tasks.
Zhang et al. (2021) introduced a unique multi-stage ensemble model with outlier adap-
tation to improve credit scoring. They enhanced the local outlier factor algorithm using
bagging for noisy credit data. Their approach also included a novel feature transformation
method, stacking-based EL, and self-adaptive parameter optimization. Experiments con-
firmed the enhanced performance of the model by achieving 93.16% accuracy, 93.45%
F1-score, and 96.95% AUC on the japanese dataset.
Jin et al. (2021) introduced a multi-stage ensemble model with a hybrid GA for accurate
credit prediction. They addressed data imbalance using the VIHT technique and developed
a hybrid GA for selecting features and classifier subsets. The model utilized stacking for
final predictions and demonstrated its effectiveness by achieving 93.79% recall and 15.76%
F1-score through experiments on the unbalanced polish 2 credit dataset.
1 3

13 Page 20 of 54 H. Ayari et al.
Yotsawat et al. (2021) introduced a Cost-sensitive Neural Network Ensemble (CS-NNE)
for credit scoring. Their novel approach applied multiple class weights to address imbal-
anced classes and enhance diversity among base neural networks. The results in Table 6
demonstrated that CS-NNE outperformed single neural networks on real-world imbal-
anced credit datasets effectively addressing imbalance problems and surpassing existing
approaches achieving the highest accuracy (91.30%) on the polish dataset.
Shen et al. (2019) introduced an innovative ensemble model for assessing personal credit
risk by integrating SMOTE and classifier optimization. They rebalanced the training dataset
with SMOTE by optimizing back propagation neural networks using particle swarm optimi-
zation and built an ensemble model combining optimized back propagation neural network
classifiers with AdaBoost. The results presented in table 6 showed that the model achieved
the best on the australian dataset with 90.58% accuracy, 95.40% F1-score, 91.03% AUC,
and 90.94% G-mean.
Jiao et al. (2021) introduced an advanced ensemble model to enhance image feature clas-
sification. Their approach combined a CNN for feature extraction and an XGBoost classifier
for classification. They optimized the model using an improved particle swarm optimization
algorithm to fine-tune hyperparameters. The results on the image and credit dataset in table
6 showed the model’s superior performance achieving the best results on the australian
dataset with 88.20% accuracy and 87.43% F1-score.
Chen et al. (2020) proposed a unique ensemble model using the generalized shapley
value and the choquet integral. They utilized fuzzy measures to capture interactions among
base learners using a linear programming model. Representing base learner-predicted val-
ues with fuzzy numbers preserved original information. The ensemble model’s anticipated
value was computed using the Generalized Shapley Choquet Integral (GSCI) aggregation
operator. Their GSCI-based ensemble credit scoring approach yielded robust results achiev-
ing the best values with 94.53% recall, 90.91% F1-score, and 91.43% AUC on the australian
dataset while the best accuracy was 93.35% on the RRDai dataset.
Zhang and Chi (2021) introduced a novel heterogeneous ensemble credit scoring
approach to address imbalanced data classification. Their model incorporated LSVM, KNN,
MDA, DT, and LR classifiers and adaptively selected the highest AUC base classifiers based
on data distribution. Merging these base classifiers yielded predictions that outperformed
baseline models by achieving 70.50% AUC on the chilean dataset. It made it useful for
actual credit scoring to manage credit risk for financial institutions.
Xing et al. (2024) proposed a stacked ensemble model integrating Random Forest,
XGBoost, and TabNet to enhance credit score prediction. By leveraging the strengths of
these high-performance models, particularly the DL capabilities of TabNet, the approach
addresses limitations of individual classifiers. The ensemble was evaluated using multiple
metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC, and demonstrated superior perfor-
mance on the Credit Score dataset.
Li et al. (2022) introduced the One-class Classification Driven Dynamical Ensemble
Learning (OCDDEL) approach. Unlike using inferred labels, OCDDEL solely relied on
accepted applications and their genuine labels. It formed a dynamic ensemble model to
handle diverse test applications. By training a one-class classifier, OCDDEL grouped test
applications and computed ensemble weights for each case based on similarity with training
applicants. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model by achieving
89.38% accuracy on the lending club dataset.
1 3

Guo et al. (2019) introduced a novel self-adaptive classifier ensemble model utiliz-
ing statistics and ML techniques to enhance prediction performance. Their multi-stage
approach included data preparation, self-adaptive selection of base classifiers with bayesian
optimization-adjusted parameters, and integration of these optimized base classifiers using
multi-layer stacking. Testing on real-world credit datasets demonstrated the model’s strong
performance on the australian dataset with 87.40% accuracy, 86.80% F1-score, and 94.00%
AUC.
Tripathi et al. (2018) aimed to merge feature selection and ensemble frameworks. They
suggested utilizing feature clustering technique k-means for selection. They then used this
reduced dataset with five base classifiers. Aggregating the outputs through weighted voting
improved the final prediction. They tested this on three datasets and compared it to existing
methods and proved the efficiency of the proposed method by achieving the best results with
87.98% accuracy and 90.69% F1-score on the japanese dataset.
5  Performance evaluation criteria
Selecting appropriate performance evaluation metrics is a critical task in credit scoring, as
each metric has its own strengths and limitations (Hand 2009). Certain models may excel
under specific criteria but perform poorly under others (Guetari et al. 2023; Gicic and Subasi
2019), making the choice of metric crucial for an accurate assessment.
A widely used approach is the confusion matrix (Table 2), which categorizes predictions
into true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. This foundation sup-
ports several derived metrics commonly employed in model evaluation.
Accuracy (formula 3), though intuitive, can be misleading with imbalanced datasets.
Precision (formula 4) and recall (formula 5) offer deeper insight into model behavior, par-
ticularly in identifying relevant positive cases. The F1-score (formula 6) combines these two
into a single metric, especially useful under class imbalance.

The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve graphically illustrates the trade-off
between sensitivity and specificity across various thresholds. Its summary statistic, the
Area Under the Curve (AUC), reflects the overall ability of a model to distinguish between
classes.
Additional comprehensive metrics include the Geometric Mean (G-Mean), which bal-
ances sensitivity and specificity (formula 7), and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) statistic,
widely used in credit scoring to measure the model’s discriminatory power.

while AUC reflects the model’s ability to distinguish between classes, which is critical for
imbalanced credit scoring datasets.
To further understand the comparative performance of different ML models, Tables 7 to
10 present the accuracy and AUC results reported in selected studies using the most com-
mon benchmark datasets: German, Australian, Japanese, and Lending Club datasets.
Across the German dataset (Table 7), the GA + NN model (Kazemi et al. 2023) achieved
the highest accuracy (91.91%) and AUC (92.60%), followed by ensemble approaches such
as AugBoost-ELM (Zou and Gao 2022) and gcForest (Li et al. 2021). On the Australian and
Japanese datasets (Tables 8, 9), Zhang et al.’s multi-stage ensemble (Zhang et al. 2021) con-
sistently outperformed other methods, achieving accuracies above 91% and AUCs above
96%. For the Lending Club dataset (Table 10), the GSCI model (Chen et al. 2020) led per-
formance with 91.70% accuracy and 93.78% AUC.
Overall, hybrid and EL approaches, particularly those integrating neural networks, opti-
mization algorithms, or boosting, demonstrated consistently superior performance. Tradi-
tional models like logistic regression or standard SVMs, while occasionally competitive,
generally exhibited lower discrimination, highlighting the advantage of advanced hybrid
architectures in credit scoring under imbalanced or noisy datasets.
6.3.1 Visual comparison of model performance
To complement the tabular summary of model performance, Figs. 2, 3, and 4 illustrate the
comparative accuracy (± standard deviation) of ML, DL, and EL models in credit scoring.
These plots provide a visual representation of variability across studies and highlight the
models that consistently achieve high predictive performance.
Figures 2, 3 and 4 show that all three families of models achieve relatively high predic-
tive accuracy, with most methods consistently above 80%. ML models demonstrate strong
performance, with Random Forest and the proposed hybrid ML approaches achieving the
highest accuracies. DL models, such as CNN and hybrid DL configurations, provide robust
performance with lower variability, indicating their ability to handle complex, high-dimen-
sional credit data. EL models, particularly XGB-BO and the proposed ensemble, capture
peak performance in certain studies, although with slightly higher variability. Overall, these
visualizations support the tabular findings, emphasizing that hybrid and ensemble architec-
tures offer top performance, while DL ensures stable outcomes and classical ML models
remain reliable benchmarks.
6.4 Theoretical contributions from scientific mapping
To analyze the intellectual structure of the credit scoring literature, we applied science map-
ping methods using VOSviewer (Van Eck and Waltman 2010), conducting two complemen-
tary analyses: bibliographic coupling and keyword co-occurrence.
6.4.1 Bibliographic coupling
Bibliographic coupling identified three main conceptual clusters among the reviewed
studies:

Dumitrescu et al. (2022) introduced the penalised logistic tree regression (PLTR), com-
bining decision tree rules with logistic regression to enhance accuracy while maintaining
interpretability. He et al. (2018) proposed an ensemble model that adapts to varying class
imbalance ratios using BalanceCascade, random forest, XGBoost, stacking, and particle
swarm optimization, influencing subsequent studies addressing data imbalance. Moscato
(2021) conducted a benchmarking study of widely used ML models for peer-to-peer lend-
ing, assessing both predictive performance and interpretability through explainable AI.
Shen et al. (2021) combined an improved SMOTE method with LSTM and AdaBoost in a
DL ensemble framework, achieving strong performance on imbalanced datasets. Bao et al.
(2019) demonstrated that integrating unsupervised learning at the consensus and clustering
stages with supervised models significantly improves performance, underscoring the value
of hybrid learning strategies in credit risk assessment.
6.6 Variables and feature selection
The reviewed studies employed a wide range of input variables, which we grouped into four
main categories, reflecting the different aspects of borrower information:
● Demographic variables: age, sex, marital status, employment type, number of depend-
ents, and residence type (such as own, rent). These variables describe the personal back-
1 3

Machine learning powered financial credit scoring: a systematic… Page 37 of 54 13
ground of the borrower.
● Financial variables: annual income, loan amount, debt-to-income ratio, monthly loan
payments, number of existing credit lines, and account balances. These indicate the bor-
rower’s current financial status and obligations.
● Behavioral variables: payment history, delinquency counts, credit utilization ratio, pre-
vious defaults, and loan repayment behavior. These variables capture the borrower’s
past creditworthiness and financial behavior (Bhandary et al. 2023).
● Transaction-level variables: recent credit inquiries, number of open accounts, new cred-
it lines opened, and overdraft history, representing recent financial activity and credit
engagement.
These categories encompass the most commonly used variables in popular credit scoring
datasets such as the German, Australian, and Japanese datasets, which formed a significant
part of the reviewed literature.
Feature selection techniques were frequently employed to enhance model performance
by identifying the most relevant variables and reducing noise. Commonly used methods
include:
● Information Gain (Lenka et al. 2022; Trivedi 2020)
● Gain Ratio (Trivedi 2020)
● Chi-square (Trivedi 2020)
● PCA (Lenka et al. 2022)
● GA (Lenka et al. 2022)
● Attribute Weighting (Cao et al. 2021)
● HS integrated for feature selection (Goh et al. 2020)
● Relief-based feature selection (Zhu et al. 2018)
● K-means clustering applied as a feature clustering technique for selection (Tripathi et al.
2018)
These techniques serve to improve input quality by selecting or transforming features, ulti-
mately leading to better predictive accuracy in credit scoring models.
7 Discussion
This section discusses the findings of the systematic review in relation to the five research
questions defined in the methodology. It synthesizes the evidence regarding the most
commonly used ML models, their strengths and limitations, evaluation practices, emerg-
ing trends, and key challenges in credit scoring. In addition to addressing these questions,
the section also presents a comparative analysis of model performance across studies to
highlight which approaches have demonstrated superior predictive capabilities in recent
literature.

7.1 RQ1: What are the most widely used ML models for credit scoring?
The most frequently applied ML models in credit scoring are detailed in Sect. 4. Tables 4, 5,
and 6 provide an overview of conventional ML, DL, and ensemble models, along with the
datasets and evaluation metrics reported across the reviewed studies.
Analysis of the reviewed studies indicates that hybrid ensemble models are the most
widely used, reflecting their ability to combine multiple algorithms, leverage complemen-
tary strengths, improve predictive accuracy, and manage heterogeneous borrower profiles.
Conventional ML models, such as LR, DTs, and SVM, remain relevant, particularly when
interpretability and simplicity are prioritized. DL models, while promising for large-scale
or high-dimensional datasets, are less frequently adopted due to their data-intensive nature
and limited interpretability.
Overall, the evidence suggests that practitioners prioritize hybrid ensemble approaches
when predictive performance is critical, whereas conventional ML models are preferred
when transparency or smaller datasets are considered.
7.2 RQ2: What are the strengths and limitations of ML models used for credit
scoring?
ML models exhibit various strengths and limitations when applied to credit scoring. Under-
standing these factors is essential for assessing their suitability in financial decision-mak-
ing. The following subsections detail the key strengths and weaknesses identified in the
literature.
7.2.1 Strengths of machine learning models
A major strength of ML models is their ability to generate accurate predictions by learning
patterns in historical data that reflect applicant behavior over time.
Many ML workflows include automated feature selection methods, reducing the need for
manual engineering and potentially uncovering novel predictive features. This automation
enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the credit scoring process. For example, DTs
are particularly effective for small datasets, providing both reliable predictions and inter-
pretability, which is essential for regulatory compliance.
DL models are well-suited for large datasets due to their ability to automatically capture
complex, non-linear relationships that traditional models often fail to identify. Their abil-
ity to handle high-dimensional data enables capturing subtle interactions among features,
which can significantly improve predictive performance in scenarios with complex bor-
rower profiles.
EL models enhance predictive performance in credit scoring by aggregating the outputs
of multiple base models, thereby reducing both bias and variance, especially when handling
heterogeneous borrower profiles. Evidence from the reviewed studies shows that ensemble
methods, particularly random forests and XGBoost, consistently achieve higher accuracy
and AUC scores than single classifiers, indicating their widespread preference in practical
credit scoring applications.
Hybrid models are another effective approach, integrating multiple algorithms to capture
diverse patterns and relationships in the data, thereby improving predictive accuracy and
1 3

robustness. They can also be customized for specific datasets and problems by selecting the
most suitable algorithms, making them highly adaptable to different credit scoring scenar-
ios. The flexibility of hybrid models allows financial institutions to tailor models to specific
borrower segments, supporting more nuanced risk assessment strategies.
7.2.2 Limitations of machine learning models
Despite their strengths, ML models exhibit several limitations, particularly in credit scor-
ing applications. One major challenge is their reliance on high-quality labeled data, which
is often difficult to obtain due to confidentiality and privacy concerns. Inadequate feature
extraction and low-quality labeled data can significantly degrade the performance of con-
ventional learning models, as illustrated by the limited effectiveness of DL models with
simpler architectures.
Model interpretability is another critical issue, particularly with complex ML techniques
such as DL. Despite their impressive accuracy, these models are often regarded as black
boxes, making their decisions difficult to interpret and raising transparency concerns. This
challenge complicates the ability of lenders and borrowers to understand the model’s logic.
Moreover, DL models are highly sensitive to the quality and quantity of training data which
makes them susceptible to bias, especially with imbalanced datasets. While techniques like
SMOTE address data imbalance, they require careful handling to avoid overfitting and
ensure robust performance.
The limited adoption of DL models in credit scoring may stem from their complexity
and lack of interpretability, especially compared to traditional and ensemble methods. The
fewer articles focusing on DL for credit scoring than other ML techniques underscore this
limitation. While ensemble models can enhance the performance of credit scoring models,
they may reduce interpretability compared to single models. The complexity of interpreting
ensemble models with multiple classifiers can be a significant drawback.
Similarly, integrating multiple models in hybrid techniques increases the complex-
ity of model construction, tuning, and validation. This added complexity often results in
higher computational overhead and extended development times. Moreover, hybrid models
demand substantial computational resources due to the integration of multiple algorithms.
Such resource intensity may hinder the scalability, practicality, and interpretability of hybrid
techniques, particularly for smaller institutions with constrained computational capabilities.
Hybrid models may also suffer from overfitting, particularly when combining complex or
deeply nested architectures.
7.2.3 Synthesis and practical implications
Overall, the literature indicates that ensemble and hybrid ML models are the most widely
used and effective approaches for credit scoring, largely due to their superior predictive per-
formance and ability to handle heterogeneous datasets. DL models offer high potential for
large, high-dimensional datasets but are constrained by interpretability and data availability
issues. For practitioners, this suggests a strategic approach: use ensemble or hybrid models
where predictive performance is critical and data availability is sufficient, while balancing
interpretability requirements to satisfy regulatory and operational needs.
1 3

13 Page 40 of 54 H. Ayari et al.
From a research perspective, these findings highlight the need to develop methods that
maintain the accuracy of complex models while improving interpretability and robustness.
Techniques such as explainable AI and careful data preprocessing are practical solutions
that bridge the gap between predictive power and transparency.
In summary, understanding these strengths and limitations not only informs model selec-
tion but also guides the implementation of ML-based credit scoring systems that are accu-
rate, fair, and operationally feasible.
7.3 RQ3: What metrics are used to evaluate machine learning credit scoring
models?
The evaluation of ML models in credit scoring relies on a variety of metrics, as summarized
in Sect. 5 and Table 3. Accuracy remains the most commonly reported metric, reflecting its
intuitive appeal. However, its reliability is limited in imbalanced datasets, which are com-
mon in credit scoring. Metrics such as AUC, F1-score, G-Mean, and KS are frequently used
to address this limitation, providing a more balanced assessment of model performance and
better reflecting the ability to correctly identify risky borrowers.
The diversity of metrics reported across studies indicates both the complexity of credit
scoring tasks and the absence of standardized evaluation protocols, making direct compari-
sons across models challenging. In practice, combining multiple metrics is essential to cap-
ture different aspects of performance, including overall predictive accuracy, minority-class
detection, and discriminatory power. These trends suggest that researchers and practitioners
recognize the importance of comprehensive evaluation to ensure models are both accurate
and reliable in real-world credit risk assessment.
7.4 RQ4: What are the emerging trends and advances in ML models for credit
scoring?
The field of credit scoring has seen significant trends and advancements with the integration
of ML techniques that promise to reshape traditional paradigms. These innovations seek
to augment the predictive capabilities and efficiency of credit scoring models, ultimately
striving towards more inclusive and robust financial practices promoting more inclusive and
robust financial practices.
7.4.1 Use of alternative data in credit scoring
Using alternative data in credit scoring is an emerging trend that enhances predictive accu-
racy by incorporating non-traditional data sources (Niu et al. 2019). Instead of relying solely
on traditional financial data, alternative data allows for the analysis of diverse informa-
tion from platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google, as well as from mobile phone
usage data. Psychometric assessments are emerging as new tools for evaluating borrower
creditworthiness through alternative credit scoring models. This trend is particularly valu-
able for borrowers lacking sufficient financial history or considered too risky by traditional
models. It provides lenders with alternative indicators to assess borrower behavior and
creditworthiness.
1 3

Machine learning powered financial credit scoring: a systematic… Page 41 of 54 13
These trends reflect a dual emphasis in current credit scoring research: improving predic-
tive accuracy with novel data and models, while ensuring transparency and interpretability
for regulatory compliance and ethical lending.
Various studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of using alternative data sources
such as social media, mobile phone usage, and psychometric assessments to improve credit
scoring models.
De Cnudde et al. (2019) enhanced traditional credit scoring models by incorporating
Facebook data. They categorized relationships into Look-A-likes (LAL), friends, and Best
Friends Forever (BFF). BFFs displayed stronger predictive value than friends, while inter-
est-driven LAL data surpassed social network data showing the promising future of face-
book data in microfinance.
Yu et al. (2020) addressed “real but false data” challenges in credit assessment using dou-
ban’s social media data. Their criteria-driven data cleansing, including activity and network
ratios, led to significant credit score rank changes. This work contributed to trustworthy
credit evaluation from social media data, helping to mitigate risks in the internet finance
sector.
Niu et al. (2019) investigated using borrowers’ mobile phone-derived social network data
for loan default prediction. LR and ML methods (RF, AdaBoost, LightGBM) confirmed the
significant correlation of the data with loan default and its potential to enhance credit scor-
ing accuracy.
Kulkarni and Dhage (2019) introduced the “Information Trustworthiness” credit scoring
system to fuse legacy and emotional/social scores. By leveraging social media interactions
and reliable data sources, this system enhances accuracy. The resulting advanced credit
score considers personality traits effectively distinguishing default history and non-users,
surpassing traditional methods. The use of these alternative datasets aligns with the evolu-
tion of credit scoring methodologies reflecting the progressive nature of the advancements
in the field.
For the use of mobile phone data, Shema (2019) demonstrated that precise credit scor-
ing models could be built using airtime recharge data, a less invasive option for the privacy
of borrowers. Testing against traditional models using loan data, their approach performed
equally well and suggested the potential for digital lenders to enhance credit scoring while
respecting privacy.
Ots et al. (2020) highlighted the practicality of using mobile phone usage data for credit
scoring with a small dataset of 2,503 customers. Employing diverse classification methods,
they achieved a 62% AUC in predicting payment behavior. This approach is particularly
valuable for smaller companies lacking access to extensive datasets.
Óskarsdóttir et al. (2020) proposed a smartphone-based microlending as a means to
enhance financial inclusion. Their approach refined credit scoring models by engineering
user data into pseudo-social networks and merging network analysis and ML. Ethical con-
siderations guided this methodology and offered the potential to elevate micro-lending app
performance and extend global financial access.
Typically, psychometrics is used to evaluate mental, behavioral, and cognitive traits. The
rationale behind incorporating them into credit scoring lies in their potential to reveal cer-
tain personality characteristics that might offer insights into an individual’s propensity to
fulfill financial obligations (Djeundje et al. 2021).
1 3

13 Page 42 of 54 H. Ayari et al.
Sifrain (2020) examined the Entrepreneurial Financial Lab (EFL) psychometric test
credit scoring model in microfinance using Sogesol. They found the EFL tool outperformed
the existing model of Sogesol, though the psychometric model showed limited predictive
power. Introducing a new credit scoring model with socio-economic and behavioral fac-
tors improved performance. They suggested enhancing credit risk management potential at
Sogesol.
Rabecca et al. (2018) investigated adding psychometric testing to the credit scoring sys-
tem, alongside demographic factors. Their Indonesian case study with PT. Amartha mikro
fintek revealed improved credit risk prediction using a combined approach. The psychologi-
cal test was implemented efficiently, with completion possible within five minutes. Back-
ground factors from borrowers and company officers influenced testing time.
Djeundje et al. (2021) assessed predictive accuracy with alternative data for credit risk
assessment. Combining email, psychometric, and demographic variables outperformed
using demographics alone. This enhanced accuracy supports using email and demographic
data when credit history is absent. Similar outcomes were observed with psychometric data.
Despite variable results from different sample splits, the approach remains promising. Their
study also explored email usage as a predictor using diverse classifiers and identified alter-
natives for credit risk prediction when traditional data was scarce.
This innovative approach, driven by advancements in ML and big data analytics, offers
promising avenues for enhancing credit risk assessment and fostering financial inclusion.
The use of alternative data sources such as social media, mobile phone data, and psycho-
metric assessments reflects the evolution of credit scoring methodologies in response to
advances in financial technology.
These findings imply that alternative data is most valuable when traditional credit history
is sparse or absent, offering lenders a pathway to expand financial inclusion. However, the
benefits are not uniform across all contexts: improvements depend heavily on data qual-
ity, platform penetration, and the stability of behavioral signals over time. Moreover, reli-
ance on social media or psychometric variables raises concerns about privacy, fairness,
and potential proxy discrimination, making careful governance and regulatory oversight
essential. In practice, this means that while alternative data can enhance predictive accuracy,
it should be integrated as a complement rather than a replacement for traditional financial
indicators, with clear safeguards for consent, transparency, and ethical use.
7.4.2 Explainability and interpretability of machine learning models for credit scoring
Interpretability and explainability are critical emerging trends and advancements in the
development of ML models for credit scoring. Although often used interchangeably, these
terms have distinct meanings. Interpretability refers to the ability to understand model pre-
dictions without fully analyzing the internal mechanisms. Explainability, on the other hand,
involves clarifying the internal workings of these models in human-understandable terms.
These concepts have gained attention due to the necessity for transparency in ML mod-
els. The need arises from the desire to understand how and why a particular borrower is
granted or denied a loan (Bussmann et al. 2021). Additionally, the proprietary nature and
increasing complexity of these models make it difficult for specialists to understand their
inner workings.
1 3

Machine learning powered financial credit scoring: a systematic… Page 43 of 54 13
Consequently, developing tools that can explain these models in a reliable and inter-
pretable manner has become crucial. LIME and SHAP are two methods used to explain
predictions of black-box models. LIME uses locally accurate explanations for individual
predictions based on the assumption of local linearity. SHAP values explain predictions by
quantifying the marginal contribution of each feature to the prediction.
Bussmann et al. (2021) proposed an interpretable AI model for credit risk management,
especially in peer-to-peer lending. Using correlation networks and Shapley values, the
model groups AI predictions by shared explanations. Analyzing 15,000 small businesses,
the study found that similar financial characteristics could explain and predict credit scores
for both risky and non-risky borrowers.
Bücker et al. (2022) proposed a framework for enhancing the interpretability of credit
scoring models to align with transparency, auditability, and explainability goals for "black
box" ML models. By using methods such as LIME and SHAP, they showed that interpret-
ability comparable to traditional scorecards can be achieved while preserving predictive
capabilities.
Ayari and Guetari (2025) emphasized the importance of interpretability in credit scor-
ing models, showing that while EL improves predictive accuracy, understanding the role of
individual features and base learners is crucial for transparency and trust. Using SHAP, their
approach quantified the contribution of each feature and classifier, supporting regulatory
compliance and ethical decision-making.
Bussmann et al. (2021) utilized LIME and SHAP to explain ML-based credit scoring
models on the lending club dataset. Local and global insights were gained using these tech-
niques and SHAP kernel comparisons were explored. The results proved that LIME and
SHAP provided consistent explanations that are in line with financial logic.
By embracing these trends, the credit scoring domain is making an impressive move
toward merging the power of ML with comprehensibility. Thus, the goal is to balance data
availability with building trust among regulators by ensuring ML models are transparent
and understandable.
The broader implication of these advances is that explainability has shifted from a techni-
cal option to a regulatory and operational requirement. By making complex models intel-
ligible to credit officers, auditors, and borrowers, tools such as SHAP and LIME not only
foster trust but also help detect instability or bias in model predictions. This means that the
successful deployment of ML in credit scoring now depends as much on interpretability and
accountability as on predictive performance. Future developments will likely need to bal-
ance model complexity with explainability, ensuring that accuracy gains are not achieved at
the expense of transparency or compliance.
7.5 RQ5: What are the challenges in adopting ML models for credit scoring?
The adoption of ML models in credit scoring presents numerous challenges, despite their
potential to significantly enhance predictive accuracy and efficiency. Among these chal-
lenges, three critical issues stand out: interpretability, potential biases, and the curse of
dimensionality. These aspects are critical to ensuring models are not only effective but also
equitable and transparent. In this subsection, we delve into these challenges.
1 3

13 Page 44 of 54 H. Ayari et al.
7.5.1 Interpretability
Interpretability continues to pose a significant challenge in applying complex ML models
to credit scoring. Although these models can offer high predictive accuracy, their decision-
making processes are often opaque, which makes it difficult for lenders to understand how
credit decisions are made. This lack of transparency can be problematic for borrowers and
regulators who require clear explanations for credit outcomes. Thus, achieving a balance
between high interpretability and predictive performance is therefore a complex task.
Techniques such as LIME and SHAP have been developed to enhance the interpretability
of black-box models. While these methods offer valuable insights into model predictions,
they can sometimes provide inconsistent explanations for similar input data and may not
fully uncover underlying model biases. Additionally, these techniques can be susceptible to
adversarial attacks (Slack et al. 2020), raising concerns about their reliability in sensitive
applications like credit scoring. Failure to address this challenge may result in difficulties
aligning model outputs with regulatory requirements and industry standards, potentially
leading to a lack of trust in credit scoring systems.
Consequently, the need to develop and implement effective techniques for model inter-
pretability remains a pressing concern in the field of credit scoring. These techniques should
not only make the decision-making process of ML models more understandable but also
ensure that critical insights are clear in a way that aids in informed credit risk assessment.
7.5.2 Potential biases
Biases in training datasets can lead ML models to exhibit unfairness based on several cri-
teria. In credit scoring, for example, these criteria may include age, gender, race, caste, and
religion, among others. Therefore, addressing bias is a major challenge in developing ML
models, as they can perpetuate existing disparities if not carefully designed. In credit scor-
ing, failure to address bias can lead to serious consequences, including the reinforcement of
social inequalities and ethical concerns (Ahmed 2022).
To mitigate biases, various techniques can be employed, including pre-processing, in-
processing, and post-processing methods (Jammalamadaka and Itapu 2023). Pre-processing
techniques involve manipulating the training data to reduce bias before model training. In-
processing techniques can be integrated directly into the learning process to adjust model
parameters during training to eliminate bias. Post-processing techniques refine model out-
puts to meet fairness criteria after initial predictions are made. Although mitigating bias
remains complex, these proactive measures can significantly enhance the fairness and reli-
ability of credit scoring systems.
7.5.3 The curse of dimensionality
The curse of dimensionality presents significant challenges when applying ML to high-
dimensional data. As the number of dimensions increases, computational demands rise,
resulting in longer training times and greater memory consumption. Sparse data in high-
dimensional spaces can lead to overfitting as models struggle to generalize. Models are
more likely to learn noise and irrelevant patterns, which adversely affect accuracy. Similarly,
distance-based metrics become less meaningful, affecting algorithms such as clustering and
1 3

Machine learning powered financial credit scoring: a systematic… Page 45 of 54 13
KNN. High-dimensional data increases model variability, complicating performance evalu-
ation and necessitating careful hyperparameter tuning (Jia et al. 2022).
Effective feature selection methods can help address these challenges. Techniques such
as filter, wrapper, and embedded approaches are used to reduce the number of features while
maintaining model generalization (Laborda and Ryoo 2021). Filter methods assess individ-
ual features based on statistical measures like correlation, information gain, or chi-square
tests to identify those with greater predictive power. Wrapper methods evaluate different
feature subsets using a chosen ML model, such as forward selection, backward elimination,
or recursive feature elimination. While these methods provide a more exhaustive search by
considering the interaction between features, they can be computationally expensive for
large feature spaces. Embedded methods integrate feature selection into the model train-
ing process, optimizing feature relevance as part of the learning algorithm. By applying
appropriate feature selection techniques, the impact of the curse of dimensionality can be
managed to enhance the robustness of ML models.
7.5.4 Behavioral and attitudinal data integration
In addition to technical and data-related challenges, recent research has highlighted the
importance of borrowers’ attitudes and behavioral factors in credit risk assessment. Accord-
ing to a qualitative study on educational loan repayment by postgraduate students in India
(Bhandary et al. 2023), loan repayment is influenced by both ability and willingness to
repay. While ability is commonly measured through financial indicators, willingness is
reflected in attitudinal dimensions such as credit history, debt utility, financial knowledge,
prioritizing repayment, and integrity. The study also identified gratification, debt burden,
and lifestyle preferences as negative attitudes associated with delinquency. Integrating such
subjective dimensions into ML models remains a significant challenge due to the difficulty
in collecting and quantifying such data. However, doing so could improve the predictive
power and fairness of credit scoring systems, especially in contexts like student or microfi-
nance loans where attitudinal variables play a more pronounced role.
7.5.5 Synthesis of challenges and practical implications
Overall, these challenges illustrate that while ML models can enhance predictive perfor-
mance, practical adoption in credit scoring requires careful attention to interpretability,
fairness, and feature management. Addressing interpretability is crucial for regulatory com-
pliance and maintaining borrower trust. Mitigating bias ensures equitable lending decisions
and aligns with ethical standards. Managing high-dimensional data through feature selec-
tion not only improves computational efficiency but also reduces overfitting and enhances
generalization. Integrating behavioral and attitudinal data, although complex, can signifi-
cantly improve model accuracy and inclusiveness, especially for non-traditional borrower
segments such as students or microfinance clients. Together, these considerations highlight
that successful ML deployment in credit scoring is as much about responsible model design
and data handling as it is about predictive accuracy.

7.6 Comparison with existing literature reviews
This SLR differs from and extends prior surveys in several important ways. Existing
reviews, such as Dastile et al. (2020), focused primarily on the performance of individual
ML and ensemble classifiers from 2010 to 2018. Their review identified ensemble classi-
fiers like RFs and XGBoost as outperforming single models, and highlighted CNNs as the
leading DL architecture. Our results confirm these observations, particularly the consistent
high performance of ensemble and hybrid models across benchmark datasets. However, our
review includes a broader range of ensemble and hybrid techniques, such as GA-NN and
multi-stage ensemble models, which demonstrated even higher accuracy and AUC in recent
studies.
This study (Kumar et al. 2021) presented a SLR focused on credit scoring within rural
finance, emphasizing how fintech and AI technologies are transforming credit assessment
in underserved areas. Their review highlighted the limitations of traditional banking in rural
contexts and the benefits of integrating ML models such as ANN, SVM, RF, and hybrid
approaches to improve financial inclusion. While their findings emphasized the socio-eco-
nomic impact and regulatory considerations, their performance analysis remained largely
conceptual. In contrast, our review adopts a broader technical scope, systematically com-
paring model performance across standard benchmark datasets and incorporating recent
advancements such as model interpretability (SHAP, LIME) and alternative data sources
(social media, mobile phone usage, psychometrics). Therefore, our work complements by
providing detailed empirical evidence and expanding the applicability of ML credit scoring
models beyond rural-focused contexts
Hayashi (2022) emphasized the dominance of Deep Belief Networks and CNNs, and
discussed the challenges of interpretability and the potential of transforming structured data
into image-like formats. In contrast, our findings reveal that while DL methods do show
promise, they remain less commonly applied than ensemble or hybrid methods, largely due
to their complexity and lower interpretability in practice.
Lenka et al. (2022) focused on ensemble models for imbalanced data and highlighted the
use of SMOTE and GA for feature selection. Our results corroborate this trend by showing
that models using SMOTE, GAs, and ensemble classifiers tend to achieve higher perfor-
mance, especially on imbalanced datasets such as Lending Club and German credit data.
Additionally, we found that the integration of GA with NN or boosting further improves
performance, which was not explored in their review.
Other surveys such as Markov et al. (2022) and Kamimura et al. (2023) provided histori-
cal and methodological overviews, highlighting the shift from traditional models (like LR,
DTs) to hybrid and DL approaches. Our review confirms this evolution, but also emphasizes
new developments such as the use of alternative data (social media, mobile usage, psycho-
metrics) and the growing importance of explainability techniques like SHAP and LIME,
which were not widely discussed in previous SLRs.
Moreover, previous reviews often lacked detailed, ranked comparisons of model perfor-
mance across datasets. Our review contributes uniquely in this regard by compiling ranked
tables of accuracy and AUC on four widely used datasets. This offers a clearer picture of the
comparative effectiveness of different models and configurations.
In summary, while our findings align with prior work in recognizing the value of ensem-
ble and hybrid models for credit scoring, we extend existing literature by incorporating
1 3

Machine learning powered financial credit scoring: a systematic… Page 47 of 54 13
more recent developments, evaluating a wider set of techniques and datasets, and offering
practical comparisons across metrics and model types. We also address emerging themes
like interpretability, alternative data, and algorithmic fairness, which are increasingly cen-
tral to responsible credit scoring.
A recent study by Bhandary and Ghosh (2025) offered a comprehensive empirical com-
parison of both traditional and modern ML techniques for credit scoring, using a well known
real world dataset. Their work compared models such as LR, linear discriminant analysis,
SVMs, RF, XGBoost, and deep neural networks, and showed that DL models achieved
the highest predictive performance in terms of F1-score, G-mean, and AUC. Their results
confirmed that, while statistical methods like LR still offered competitive accuracy, modern
ML approaches (particularly deep neural networks) consistently outperformed traditional
techniques across several performance metrics.
Notably, the study also addressed interpretability concerns in complex models by ana-
lyzing feature importance within the deep neural network. It found that behavioral factors
such as age and payment history were key predictors, reinforcing earlier literature empha-
sizing the role of personal characteristics and repayment behavior in default prediction.
Although the study did not specifically address credit utilization, recent literature (Bhandary
and Ghosh 2025) has emphasized its critical role in dynamic scoring, suggesting that high
utilization by reliable borrowers may actually signal profitability for lenders. Furthermore,
while Bhandary et al. discussed LGD in the context of aligning scoring with risk based
capital planning, complementary work has stressed the importance of incorporating IFRS 9
standards holistically, particularly PD, EAD, and LGD, to ensure compliance and financial
soundness in advanced scoring models.
8 Limitations of this review
Firstly, this study included peer-reviewed journal papers and conference articles related to
credit scoring. Our initial search filtration strategy yielded a large number of articles. Sev-
eral non-relevant studies were subsequently identified and excluded. This process ensured
that the selected research papers met the inclusion criteria of the study. Nonetheless, includ-
ing more related papers would have enriched our conclusions.
Secondly, the search for articles was confined to only four online databases: IEEE Xplore,
ACM Digital Library, Springer Link, and Google Scholar. Nonetheless, there may be other
digital libraries with relevant studies that were overlooked. Moreover, identifying all rel-
evant research published within the five-year scope of our investigation proved challenging
due to the increasing volume of studies in the field of credit scoring using ML techniques.
Despite this limitation, our exhaustive exploration provides valuable insights into the cur-
rent landscape of credit scoring research employing ML methodologies.
Finally, this review lacks a comparative analysis to identify the most effective models
for credit scoring. This challenge stems from the fact that the articles reviewed often used
different evaluation metrics, even when relying on common datasets. As a result, any com-
parison would be subjective and potentially unreliable.

9 Conclusion
This SLR aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of ML applications in financial credit
scoring from 2018 to 2024. By examining 63 carefully selected studies, the review identi-
fied the major ML methodologies employed, evaluated their strengths and limitations, and
highlighted current trends and challenges in the domain.
The key findings indicate that ensemble and hybrid models, which often combine fea-
ture optimization and multiple classifiers, consistently outperform traditional single models
in terms of accuracy and discrimination power across popular credit scoring datasets. DL
techniques show promise with large datasets but face limitations related to interpretability
and data availability. Moreover, the integration of alternative data sources such as social
media, mobile usage, and psychometric data is an emerging trend that can enhance credit
scoring, particularly for borrowers lacking formal credit histories. The growing emphasis
on explainability methods such as LIME and SHAP demonstrates the field’s commitment to
transparency and regulatory compliance.
The implications of these findings are significant for researchers, practitioners, and finan-
cial institutions. ML offers improved predictive capabilities and operational efficiencies, but
challenges around model interpretability, bias mitigation, and computational complexity
remain barriers to widespread adoption. Addressing these issues is critical for building trust-
worthy, fair, and scalable credit scoring systems that promote financial inclusion.
This review is limited by the heterogeneity of datasets, evaluation metrics, and method-
ologies in the literature, which complicates direct performance comparisons. Additionally,
while this SLR highlights key trends and challenges, the fast-evolving nature of ML means
continuous updates are necessary to capture new advances.
Future research should focus on establishing standardized benchmarking protocols to
enable fair and consistent evaluation of credit scoring models. Investigating robust integra-
tion of alternative data with privacy safeguards, developing more interpretable and bias-
aware models, and exploring scalable solutions suitable for diverse institutional contexts
are promising directions. Emphasis on real-world deployment challenges and ethical con-
siderations will also be essential to translate research advances into practical credit risk
management tools.
